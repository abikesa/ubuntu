1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
Patrick: It did.

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.119
sarahkayongo: It says, how

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:18.370
sarahkayongo: how urgent it was. You know how urgently they needed feedback. And you know they're like, Oh, yeah, take your time, I mean, just make sure you submit. Give us the feedback

4
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.239
sarahkayongo: before, so we can understand the changes.

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.349
sarahkayongo: So that put me at ease.

6
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.269
sarahkayongo: and I was able to, because your other work continues.

7
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.820
sarahkayongo: But then you have to go back and correct all these.

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:51.259
sarahkayongo: And then actually, once you put your mind to to making the corrections, you'd be surprised to realize they are not when professors are speaking back at you or giving you feedback

9
00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:07.530
sarahkayongo: this thinking big terms, and it may feel like you have to almost change entire. But but then, when I realized, okay, they were actually minimal. And that's the same thing. I've experienced in publishing.

10
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:22.760
sarahkayongo: Right? You think that is bad. You try publishing a paper, and you submit it to a journal. They come up with all sorts of, and you almost entirely have to change. I remember we've had.

11
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.400
sarahkayongo: you know, the last paper with

12
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.490
sarahkayongo: the

13
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.870
sarahkayongo: We publish.

14
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.289
Patrick: It took us a long time, because every journal we realized, okay, we need to stop

15
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.839
sarahkayongo: because we almost change the type. Not only that type we reached up point or like.

16
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.400
sarahkayongo: This is no longer.

17
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.880
sarahkayongo: You read paper every every, every editor, every reviewer is giving us all sorts of feedback.

18
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.710
Patrick: so

19
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.040
sarahkayongo: don't get so that is called pijon hauling yourself

20
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.879
sarahkayongo: so don't get pigeon told

21
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.490
sarahkayongo: and I think a week is good enough. It's sufficient. There's nothing wrong.

22
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.659
sarahkayongo: Okay? So another thing is, maybe give it another week. If you have to

23
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:23.350
sarahkayongo: understand the deadline for submitting the changes a a negotiate, for you know an extension, if need be.

24
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.489
sarahkayongo: and give it a fresh new set of ads. But the question is motivation.

25
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.710
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, motivation is the origin of everything. You can't start something until

26
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:46.839
Abimereki Muzaale: you have the motivation. Otherwise it will just be a thought. But so the question is motivation. How do you get to action?

27
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.420
Abimereki Muzaale: And that's that. That is original question.

28
00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:03.410
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, what you're giving is advice, but advice does not affect motivation motivation from from within.

29
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:13.650
sarahkayongo: Motivation is from within, not from without, within. Yes, yes, yes, so you cannot advise. That's an external that's external influence you can't advise right now. You you feel what you

30
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:23.590
sarahkayongo: experiencing is burnout. Give me time. That's African.

31
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.089
Abimereki Muzaale: A European will take coffee

32
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.930
Patrick: and will roll

33
00:03:45.790 --> 00:04:02.939
Abimereki Muzaale: I Europeans, and is like this before drinking coffee all day. Not for fun. No one finds coffee delicious. It's bitter by definition, yeah, drink espresso. First of all, sure that they're not interested in the taste, the quantity.

34
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.750
Patrick: It's so tiny. The cups are microscopic. They're like so tiny. But then dots

35
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:25.370
Abimereki Muzaale: Americans cannot handle that call. It's too bitter. So Americans add a lot of water. But America and milk and sugar have a tiny, very tiny cookie with it, because very bitter. So then a drink? No, he's having coffee for fun

36
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:47.779
Abimereki Muzaale: you know. It's not delicious. It's not delicious. Let me pull up slides. Of course, what I'm pulling up touching you'll be already familiar with.

37
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.139
Abimereki Muzaale: but I would pull it up, anyway.

38
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.320
Abimereki Muzaale: How to find it!

39
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.560
Patrick: II will certainly try that out. I think I should also add some little milk to it.

40
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.150
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, that's that's that's

41
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:27.969
Abimereki Muzaale: blood pressure at all in all of this. Yeah, we talked about.

42
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:39.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, right now, actually, III right now, I'm not healthy physically. Yeah. And and is that good? Is that? But that's a different question.

43
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.939
Abimereki Muzaale: But I know I've not done a good job. Health, wise physically.

44
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:54.800
Abimereki Muzaale: But this is this has come. This graph has come from one of my students. So I have about 300 students I've taught in the last 2 years.

45
00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.059
Abimereki Muzaale: I noticed in the reviews until until was it may I can't remember May, June.

46
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:11.279
Abimereki Muzaale: and the way, more negative than I expected, which is very shocking. I was very surprised. No, my

47
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.880
Abimereki Muzaale: classes that I'm teaching were very negative

48
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:22.909
Abimereki Muzaale: notice. Students are not very impressed

49
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:41.259
Abimereki Muzaale: but one student made a comment and said, I need to get remedial classes in educational learning theory. Oh, I need to do that. Did you ever take those at all? I did not do any classes, but I just give III remember that comment stuck

50
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:54.229
Abimereki Muzaale: the comments stuck. I was looking for remedial classes or anything. But I run into this graph.

51
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.770
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

52
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:08.390
Abimereki Muzaale: I run into this graph. I know I give you the code for the scrub, but I updated it now so I can give you the quote again. And you can reproduce this using Google or the Google call up, Yeah.

53
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:18.820
Abimereki Muzaale: so this graph for me is as turned out to be so powerful. It describes everything. Yeah.

54
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.259
Abimereki Muzaale: that in life this is not only for students. Or you can think of all of us as students of life.

55
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

56
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:39.660
Abimereki Muzaale: then in life, you're gonna find challenges and the the level that we should find them quantified. Yeah, just let's just say so this is a skill of 0 to 10. And this and your skill level is 0 to 10.

57
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:51.359
Abimereki Muzaale: As you can imagine, everyone probably has experience situation where you have a challenge exceeding your skills. emotional state, you're emotional state.

58
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.090
Abimereki Muzaale: It's not gonna be bored. It's gonna be closer to anxious. Yeah.

59
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:07.279
Abimereki Muzaale: In charge. That exceeds your your skills where you cannot see how you're gonna solve this, especially if it's a challenge that's relevant that you can just walk away from

60
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.619
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah your your emotions are, gonna be in this zone.

61
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:23.150
Abimereki Muzaale: and or if your skills are exceeding like 6 exceeding a challenge of 2, yeah. you're more likely to be bored

62
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.640
Abimereki Muzaale: or relaxed. Yeah.

63
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.580
Patrick: Body. But when

64
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:33.830
Abimereki Muzaale: when your challenge is high, let's say here, close to 3,

65
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:41.900
Abimereki Muzaale: and your your skill is like just 1.5, and you step up your game. You step it up.

66
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:49.650
Abimereki Muzaale: And yeah, you're in the board of Re, the red zone and stupid. I've been up in this yellow game. That's a zone of engagement.

67
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.499
Abimereki Muzaale: Your mind is so absorbed and then you experience victory

68
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.539
Abimereki Muzaale: as you go away from

69
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:04.449
Abimereki Muzaale: the pink zone, and you feel victory around here when you're almost hitting the green zone. Yeah. the feeling of victory.

70
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:10.430
Abimereki Muzaale: and only be produced if you felt anxious anxiety.

71
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:37.020
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, you can never fill victory unless you feel that anxiety and I've overcome the victory is overcoming a challenge, whether it's a challenger in war or in sports, definitely what is the best example? But in modern life, where there's less war, these sports or politics challenger rifle.

72
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.959
Abimereki Muzaale: When you win, you move from a zone of anxiety to victory. Yeah.

73
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.530
Patrick: hmm,

74
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:52.010
Abimereki Muzaale: And so this is only producible. If you're following the Yellow zone, the feeling, the psychology of victory.

75
00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:02.530
Abimereki Muzaale: But if you rest in your laurels and as as a sitting, Sarah, and become bleed like a ship and follow some 23 for the rest of your life.

76
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.680
Abimereki Muzaale: You've been in green green postures.

77
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.560
Abimereki Muzaale: steel waters. It means

78
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:20.619
Abimereki Muzaale: you are not going to seek bigger challenges again. Yeah. Well, that's that's why the song is roded because it connects.

79
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:41.319
Abimereki Muzaale: I would like most people, desire you hear people so. Oh, I want to retire. Yes, but then there's some people who will never be content as soon as they finish. Yeah, exactly as soon as experience victory

80
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.440
Abimereki Muzaale: to them. There's only one meaning. I need a higher challenge.

81
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.740
Abimereki Muzaale: You change environment.

82
00:10:49.890 --> 00:11:09.870
Abimereki Muzaale: you change. And the chat engine

83
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:26.719
Abimereki Muzaale: they but the other thing that I haven't shown here is what are the molecules? Molecular changes in the brain that goes anxiety? So it's nora adrenaline. It's a molecule that has a modification of adrenaline for noradrenaline adrenaline doesn't get to the brain.

84
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.830
Abimereki Muzaale: it's in the rest of the body.

85
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:42.550
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no, no! Produced by the body. Coffee is not produced by the body. Yes.

86
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.200
Abimereki Muzaale: so

87
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:58.190
Abimereki Muzaale: sort of yeah. So some things we produce anxiety. But the best examples of anxiety. Things that produce anxiety are real life challenges. That is so important, I think, your skills, your skills are not sufficient.

88
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:14.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, if the line jumps into the room right now, I worry. Yeah, that's a challenge. I understand very well. And I can tell you, sort of relevant to you civilized modern person. You really don't have the skills

89
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:21.920
Abimereki Muzaale: 200 lines. So you've been actual. I in in medicine, they say. They call adrenaline in the fight.

90
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:32.369
Abimereki Muzaale: Fright, flight home on you get into the mode of fighting, or fly flying away fright or getting scared fright.

91
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.139
Abimereki Muzaale: That's what adrenaline does. So that's a rig song

92
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.870
Abimereki Muzaale: the the green zone of boredom. The molecule is called and and

93
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.279
Abimereki Muzaale: it's a molecule. N, mda.

94
00:12:43.310 --> 00:13:00.100
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, we know. What is it? Gaba? Gaba gamma? The third Greek letter am mine will be tyric acid. Gaba GABA. Gamma B Tyric acid. It's the molecules produced when you take volume.

95
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:08.039
Abimereki Muzaale: Volume is yes, it makes you sleep alcohol.

96
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:22.839
Abimereki Muzaale: What's exactly the same as volume in the same exact location as a brain that. So alcohol because of relaxation. That's why it's the most famous beverage on the planet. Every culture

97
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.690
Abimereki Muzaale: alcohol is very popular because

98
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.200
Abimereki Muzaale: people are stressed. Yeah.

99
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.460
if you want a quick fix

100
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:39.860
Abimereki Muzaale: when you're anxious. I can assure you. Yeah, human, you might need to figure it out

101
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:51.619
Abimereki Muzaale: a long time ago. It's called alcohol. Yeah. Well, that that's a moral judgment. Biology, molecular biology. Yeah.

102
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.990
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, molecular biology.

103
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.170
Abimereki Muzaale: That it is very effective

104
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:04.119
Abimereki Muzaale: volume is manufactured. But alcohol is a product of nature, as in what's called fermentation.

105
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:15.419
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So the human race discovered ages ago. That's why it shows up in Scripture, I think probably never is.

106
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:21.600
Abimereki Muzaale: because it's going to be abused has to be abused because there's a lot of anxiety, a lot of stress.

107
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:27.299
Abimereki Muzaale: And if you discover the ultimate solution, it's not an ultimate solution. It just takes away the feeling

108
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:53.490
Abimereki Muzaale: it takes with the molecule. Yeah, but it doesn't solve any problem adrenaline and produces gaba tyric acid, which is the molecule for relaxation, the feeling of relaxation. But the yellow zone, the molecule is called dopamine.

109
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.029
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, actually, it's what's released when you eat for a good meal. Huh!

110
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.960
Abimereki Muzaale: Or when you're victorious, literally.

111
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:21.260
Abimereki Muzaale: So, yeah, you get that. But guess what alcohol also produces. Dopamine really causes what it really is. Dopamine. So but there are many other drugs of abuse, most drugs of abuse in a yellow produce dopamine.

112
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.139
Abimereki Muzaale: That's why they're dangerous.

113
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Because if you can get victory, a feeling of victory without any effort.

114
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.220
Abimereki Muzaale: That's good. You're going to abuse that

115
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.440
Abimereki Muzaale: you get hooked on. It

116
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:49.839
Abimereki Muzaale: does not produce feeling of victory actually may create anxiety. However.

117
00:15:49.890 --> 00:16:00.580
Abimereki Muzaale: if you're taking the coffee with explicit purpose of overcoming the challenge. and you're focusing. it's going to drive it towards victory.

118
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:12.220
Abimereki Muzaale: And the you will repeat, you'll hit, repeat, just keep it me. That's what I've done since May. For me it is mostly anxiety, as in the class of people are off my edge

119
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.890
Abimereki Muzaale: and I could not understand a single thing in data sciences. I all the time.

120
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.409
Abimereki Muzaale: II remember the first lecture. I literally understood exactly 0.

121
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.400
Abimereki Muzaale: Everything that has mentioned they would talk of

122
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:36.370
Abimereki Muzaale: the time. I don't use the Times because I didn't understand them. You may not understand them, too. But all the things I picked

123
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:49.969
Abimereki Muzaale: II had call up is that's the place where, if for status, for status, you want to try, call up. But you do not want that's you walk for should evolve to Vs code. I wrote that down.

124
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:59.980
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I didn't understand anything that was being said. But I wrote that down. I was like, Oh, so if you novice call up. So I went to call up. I just very straightforward let Google call up. That's our recommended

125
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:15.380
Abimereki Muzaale: because you can literally go ahead.

126
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:21.220
Abimereki Muzaale: This is being recorded. And you know, let me record a shorter video because this video will be too long.

127
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:30.839
Abimereki Muzaale:  no. You showed us the code before you showed us the graph. No, what I'm saying. I'm going to record the process of reproducing this graph.

128
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.079
Patrick: Okay, did you? Did you send that code? Also by email?

129
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:45.269
sarahkayongo: I want the quote, I'm going to reproduce the process now. So just relax.

130
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:55.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Don't worry about it. Just just okay. Any.

131
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.420
sarahkayongo: Do you? Do you write code? P.

132
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:21.979
Abimereki Muzaale: Very small code? Not not Major smart major questions irrelevant because this AI, which is so advanced. Now, it's a very relevant question. Do you write code? So Uhhuh, step number one, go to Google, step number 2,

133
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.020
Abimereki Muzaale: call up. Welcome to cool up

134
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.380
Abimereki Muzaale: file file.

135
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:40.060
Abimereki Muzaale: And I'm gonna record this and put it together. I've hit file.

136
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.280
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm going to copy and paste

137
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.489
Abimereki Muzaale: from here. So you see the code that produced this is python. Yeah.

138
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.470
Abimereki Muzaale: copy. Excellent.

139
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:55.500
Abimereki Muzaale: I think the language the most popular. Second, most popular language is number one is Javascript. Copied

140
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:07.220
Abimereki Muzaale: paste it? Oh, no knowledge. You don't even know any of this knowledge here. Produced.

141
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.109
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, how about that? You can download this image.

142
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:18.130
Abimereki Muzaale: or which I strongly recommend, you can export it to your Github account. Yeah, okay.

143
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:25.729
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. So any, I'm gonna stop the recording there because it's doing this for demonstration purposes. That's a 1 min video

144
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Hmm.

145
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:35.820
sarahkayongo: You know, you should be teaching this on a on you to.

146
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:46.330
Abimereki Muzaale: That's what I'm going. Where do you think I'm going to put videos, anyway?

147
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:59.359
sarahkayongo: no, not not really posting these videos, but create. Once I learn how to code and come up with interactive things.

148
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:11.219
Abimereki Muzaale: But I know there are so many videos on Youtube instructional videos on how. So? So this one don't put this on Youtube, I'm gonna put this on my Youtube. I created a Youtube account.

149
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:16.360
Abimereki Muzaale:  so what I'm going to do is upload this.

150
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.320
Abimereki Muzaale: Even, I'm going to do this in real time. So I just see

152
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:32.220
Abimereki Muzaale: And so let's just see this process in real time. Yeah. you, too.

153
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:53.710
Abimereki Muzaale: I use the first person I was so creating a Youtube account was Lauren. I think she was like 4, 5 years old. But before, when I knew what she was doing didn't make any sense at the time.

154
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:59.029
Abimereki Muzaale: But generation was already doing these things

155
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:11.169
Abimereki Muzaale: Youtube channels like, what is a Youtube channel? Didn't make any sense. But now I see I'm pretty content for students. So whoever, even in this case for you.

156
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:20.760
Abimereki Muzaale:  so you see, create upload videos  I'm going to find this video.

157
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.520
Abimereki Muzaale: I just need to find where it's recorded.

158
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.270
Abimereki Muzaale: I can't remember.

159
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.079
Abimereki Muzaale: But I'm going to upload it. Do you have access to the the the shared notes.

160
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.690
Patrick: Okay, you send us the email

161
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.110
Abimereki Muzaale: that's

162
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:52.100
Abimereki Muzaale: in zoom. I gave you that in zoom. Yes, I got zoom. I got it, but I prefer you share in the email cause. This will go the moment I turn off. Well, by the link that is not going to die. Yeah, what I'm saying is that link is

163
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.860
Abimereki Muzaale: a real link. So if you save it somewhere

164
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.789
Abimereki Muzaale: you can access it anytime cause it will have this video that I'm going to share.

165
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:01.950
Patrick: Does that make sense?

166
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.429
sarahkayongo: Talking of coffee? Let me let me get make some coffee, I think.

167
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:11.680
Abimereki Muzaale: Actually, me, I'm experimenting walking like coffee. It's a challenge

168
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.790
sarahkayongo: really drunk. Actually, I'll I'll sleep after this. I don't have any.

169
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.379
you know. I thought it's almost morning

170
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.100
sarahkayongo: that's really bad.

171
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.789
Abimereki Muzaale: Please the video, it's time for sleep.

172
00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.930
sarahkayongo: Okay, so yeah.

173
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.599
Abimereki Muzaale: picture view, that's not a picture. This one is a video

174
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.340
Abimereki Muzaale: to the video.

175
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.570
Patrick: which one is that?

176
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.239
Abimereki Muzaale: No. And I've just recorded

177
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.850
Patrick: that they support that. So

178
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:51.650
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm now going to upload it into Youtube only to get a URL, which I'm going to embed with the

179
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.669
Abimereki Muzaale: you can now use it.

180
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.310
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so what is this about?

181
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.839
Call up Google callup.

182
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.810

Patrick: hey? He's be awake.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.960
Abimereki Muzaale: No, he's at the airport

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.249
Patrick: to drop Brand at the airport.

188
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.000
Okay?

189
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:30.449
sarahkayongo: But I mean, if we can start after this.

sarahkayongo: you can always read the the notes or join us.

193
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.599
sarahkayongo: Yeah, I don't know why I'm tired today.

194
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.010
Abimereki Muzaale: Hi, Evan. Yeah.

195
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:58.220
sarahkayongo: Greetings from all your cousins in in Europe. Welcome back! We'll come back. Those are excellent photos and wonderful moments.

196
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.610
Patrick: This is just so good to see joy. I've taken so long that seeing Joy.

197
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.840
Patrick: did you know? Huh?

198
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.089
Maybe I've I've spent time with that in the Uk.

199
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:25.169
Patrick: Oh, I went. Yes, I went to say so much, Cindy, she eventually called her. She came up and picked me up, took me for lunch at her home. Then she also is. Then, on the next day, who took me out to see London.

200
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.570
Patrick: Yeah, she cooked for me.

201
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.479
sarahkayongo: She's a good cook.

202
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:30.690
Patrick: Yeah.

203
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:36.109
Patrick: she she it was just so good being with those guys. It was so long.

204
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:55.539
Patrick: although I found not just seeing this daughter one of not seeing these daughters to be very, very in another world. I don't know what her issue is. I last met her

205
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.160
Abimereki Muzaale: 4 years old. Adventures too much.

206
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.329
Patrick: because just too much. Yeah.

207
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.040
Patrick: May met as a teenager.

208
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:16.000
Patrick: Yeah. So she just hungry. She, the mother, talks to her, she walks, away she goes, locks herself in the room, man from morning up to evening, then at night she has disappeared.

209
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.820
Patrick: Then, opening later.

210
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.429
Patrick: just saved money

211
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:27.949
Patrick: of the football.

212
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.280
Patrick: Inegelda. That one I spent so much time with her. She's so friendly. She's

213
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.210
Patrick: she's just such a good person

214
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.930
Patrick: is a nice to hunt government.

215
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.679
Patrick: She she will give her life to Christ, but I think

216
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:47.489
Patrick: the parents may not have liked that, so they quickly took her to Catholic Semi Seminary and

217
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.580
Patrick: quickly, Bubday's yeah.

218
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.519
sarahkayongo: The father was. The father is a Catholic Catholic.

219
00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:01.799
sarahkayongo: I do not know who has. Yes, so many questions.

220
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:09.980
and later on she said she wanted to give her life to Christ, and we did. We prayed. we prayed together, and she received Christ. So

221
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.569
Patrick: when this thing was done so speedy.

222
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:20.869
Patrick: I say, now, what is this? This is not good. But anyway, since she made that decision herself to give her life to Christ.

223
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.349
sarahkayongo: I know that God will take care of that.

224
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.450
Patrick: Yeah, she was there.

225
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.859
sarahkayongo: She's a very nice girl, you know. She went to law school.

226
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.820
Yes, she is a lawyer.

227
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.860
sarahkayongo: Hmm! Very smart.

228
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.640
Patrick: very shy.

229
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.819
sarahkayongo: She's a lot, but she was telling me she hated law, so she's not

230
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.629
Patrick: after training. She's probably not going to practice it.

231
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.810
sarahkayongo: Yeah, I know. I know so many lawyers who end up not

232
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.949
sarahkayongo: every field, every field has people who don't practice

233
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:28.689
Patrick: even medicine. I'm not practicing engineering school. When I finish electrical engineering, I decided

234
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:34.079
Patrick: I didn't even go. I just went, picked up my certificate. And that was

235
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.010
Patrick: yeah.

236
00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:51.270
sarahkayongo: Well, I'm doing research. I find I find it more engaging type of flow. Well, no, I'm not practice. But I'm not practicing. I'm not seeing patience.

237
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:58.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I'm finding solutions for patients. That. The the profession doesn't have solutions, for that's why research is

238
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:03.670
sarahkayongo: so. But did you enjoy the clinical?

239
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:13.490
Abimereki Muzaale: Of course I did. Very good with patience. Very good. That much I, Patience, told me. don't you miss it? No.

240
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:37.750
Abimereki Muzaale: so you let me tell you about flow zones and boredom, and what professions are not for everyone, not for me, for sure, because I can't do routine for the rest of my life. Routines and exactly 0 creativity. As long as you're creative you are in trouble being sued first of all, because a professional inherit is inherited knowledge and wisdom

241
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.219
Abimereki Muzaale: it said about your ideas, yeah, it's what's proven.

242
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.259
Abimereki Muzaale: And so you're supposed to abide.

243
00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:53.759
Abimereki Muzaale: Bring us? Why is your wisdom? That's that's so. In place like the Us. You're just exposing yourself to lawsuits.

244
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.589
Abimereki Muzaale: If anything goes wrong.

245
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.340
Abimereki Muzaale: and you did things out of line with your profession, with guidelines of your hospitals.

246
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.529
Abimereki Muzaale: You're done.

247
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.040
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

248
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:23.060
sarahkayongo: So you guys are making me feel good. Me? I chose. Actually, I wanted to be a lawyer. No, no. As a child I wanted to be a doctor. Believe it or not.

249
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:32.489
sarahkayongo: he used to expose us. He would ask us what we wanted to to be when we grew up and under before maybe

250
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.919
sarahkayongo: half of you are born.

251
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:42.690
sarahkayongo: So in Malaga they took us to the Mall. He just would take us to be exposed.

252
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.459
sarahkayongo: and then went to the Monterey.

253
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:49.779
sarahkayongo: and I said, No, I cannot deal with that.

254
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.719
Abimereki Muzaale: And

255
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:59.769
sarahkayongo: and then I think we also in high school. I do not have a good physics teacher.

256
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.969
sarahkayongo: physics of the

257
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.860
sarahkayongo: I enjoyed very much.

258
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:13.040
sarahkayongo: I actually enjoyed chemistry, but physics, Mr. Smini, who he was so mean.

259
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:24.670
sarahkayongo: So I enjoyed literature because it came naturally to me. But then I discovered economics, and then I and then

260
00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.170
sarahkayongo: in Essex, 5.

261
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.099
sarahkayongo: Professor, what's his name? The one was the

262
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.039
sarahkayongo: one in 4. Roomba Hall.

263
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:40.680
Patrick: Yeah.

264
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.820
Patrick: yes, that

265
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.050
my wife had a shop in Chicago, and mommy said I should go help her.

266
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.969
sarahkayongo: And I went, and

267
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.600
sarahkayongo: I was 16. It's 4 voc

268
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.149
sarahkayongo: I was so so I was like, what's going on

269
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.619
sarahkayongo: anyway, would wake up in the morning, and these trucks would come and unload things.

270
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:23.989
sarahkayongo: you know, consume my goods, boxes or so matchboxes, whatever whatever people, and then, as soon as before, it was wholesale is wholesale.

271
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.970
sarahkayongo: so just by Bob says.

272
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.500
sarahkayongo: keep them.

273
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.589
sarahkayongo: and as soon as the trucks leave.

274
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.710
sarahkayongo: retailers from all over the country would come and buy the boxes

275
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:56.179
sarahkayongo: like, what's happening. Yeah, this is demand and supply, and and then the prices were set every day, and they would change, and I remember being 16 years old going to the neighbor, asking every

276
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:10.149
sarahkayongo: and then from every little chip retailer. That would be a slight difference.

277
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:18.099
sarahkayongo: maybe by a hundred shillings. So 200, you know their little permissions.

278
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:32.300
sarahkayongo: and from the end of Chico is narrow. These from the beginning of Chipova to the end, the price would change. Yeah, depending on on scarcity

279
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:39.540
sarahkayongo: depending on availability. I was so then I went to Essex, and I was studying economics

280
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:44.310
sarahkayongo: and everything I would understand demand and supply in my head.

281
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.379
Abimereki Muzaale: And it's like,

282
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.859
sarahkayongo: Wait a minute. That is what was happening. They will talk about hoarding.

283
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.979
sarahkayongo: So there was no doubt

284
00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:00.790
sarahkayongo: I wanted to study business administration. That kind which was not even in market that time they had

285
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.029
Patrick: become us

286
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.270
sarahkayongo: some very archaic.

287
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.599
Patrick: very archaic program.

288
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.280
Abimereki Muzaale: No.

289
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:15.879
Abimereki Muzaale: what I'm doing here, I'm almost done here. I just want you going to find the video

290
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:22.769
Abimereki Muzaale:  available. Actually, if you click that link, I think.

291
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.610
Abimereki Muzaale: and if you can, you'll find Link you're working on now.

292
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:32.259
Abimereki Muzaale: I already worked in it. Ii just omitted something

293
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:38.949
sarahkayongo: So which other link are you talking about? The one you just posted?

294
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.139
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that's a link. But I think it's a different page.

295
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.570
Abimereki Muzaale: I have to. Yeah.

296
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.449
Abimereki Muzaale: let me get the correct page.

297
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.339
sarahkayongo: I already had it open.

298
00:33:53.470 --> 00:34:05.470
Abimereki Muzaale: You had it top end. But I don't think you have, either. I've changed the page. So if you click on it, you want actually, I think what I shared may vanish. Because I have.

299
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.969
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, I fix this problem. That's just a slight problem.

300
00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.580
Abimereki Muzaale: I have moved the link elsewhere. You'll find.

301
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:19.190
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, okay, okay. Now let me let me update it for you. I'll finish the necessary updates.

302
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:28.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Do you see, I'm working from the time you know everything I'm doing? I had no knowledge existed as of April this year.

303
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.839
Abimereki Muzaale: But now I have automated scripts, script automated.

304
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.180
Abimereki Muzaale: That's going to update everything.

305
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:44.010
Abimereki Muzaale: And how do I know all this. This is all chat. Gp, just patient by calling for patience.

306
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.980
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

307
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:53.550
Abimereki Muzaale: So like, this is script. I walk together to chat, gpt on. I just give it gives me this prompt.

308
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.100
Abimereki Muzaale: and

309
00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:02.880
Abimereki Muzaale: I fill out the prompts, and it does everything else, because everything else is so routine, others out of being the green zone board

310
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:07.470
Abimereki Muzaale: doing the same steps over and over again. So I automated them.

311
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.660
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

312
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:30.049
Abimereki Muzaale: very, very interesting. I gave you an as as an example at a conference that conference I was speaking to medical profession. The doctors. One of them asked me about you and said, Yeah.

313
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:38.829
Patrick: he doesn't. Of course he didn't know your name, but he he was very curious, right? It really understand how a

314
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:45.570
Patrick: a liver and and what kidney transplant session is. Yeah, is busy writing code

315
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:50.319
Patrick: generating code to to to do whatever better science. And

316
00:35:51.180 --> 00:36:05.139
Abimereki Muzaale: that's a great example for the right crowd.

317
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:12.670
Abimereki Muzaale: II just you see, I just just occur to me that you, Charles, and I,

318
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.480
Abimereki Muzaale: all in education.

319
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.630
Patrick: Yeah, we're all in education at the end of the day.

320
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.350
Abimereki Muzaale: So

321
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:33.690
Patrick: it's just that this doctorate I want to go back and teach. I think I have a passion for teaching. Well, I mean Phd. Is an academic degree.

322
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:39.780
Abimereki Muzaale: I was once a teacher. I love teaching.

323
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.809
Patrick: Yes, yes.

324
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:51.529
Patrick: someone. Someone's life changing because of your influence. It's that thing just rewards me in such a special way.

325
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.359
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, whose influences

326
00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:01.140
Patrick: a teacher teaching someone who is totally blank, blank, hard drive.

327
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:06.559
Patrick: Then you you start inputting knowledge. And after a year, 2 years.

328
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.129
the person becomes somebody

329
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:19.649
Patrick: because you influence. Yeah, okay, it's official. I'm giving you an updated link.

330
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:25.900
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, click, that updated link. You will get the same stuff as before. But if you go to the bottom

331
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:32.119
Abimereki Muzaale: and next to take you to next pitch, do you? Do you see

332
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.140
Abimereki Muzaale: if you click that at the top of the next page. What do you see?

333
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.590
Patrick: Just copy the link. Oh, first I'll click on the link.

334
00:37:42.660 --> 00:38:03.850
sarahkayongo: I'm on the link. So video clip of me posting

335
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:11.100
Abimereki Muzaale: the workflow coping code for python code going to call up and reproducing. But have you gone in the Youtube video?

336
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:16.949
No, it is just simply open the github, but I'm not seeing where to click.

337
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:24.190
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no. Can you share your screen? Can you share your screen?

338
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:37.909
sarahkayongo: It's part 7.

339
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:47.530
Abimereki Muzaale: And then there's a dates. If you're seeing the prayer request from the previous. If that's the page you're on, you just go to the bottom.

340
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.339
Abimereki Muzaale: and then there'll be a next. So I do not know where you are. That's why I wanted to share your screen.

341
00:38:53.440 --> 00:39:00.340
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, let me share my screen. Can you see the screen? Now? Yeah. So where? Where's the link

342
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.450
dude.

343
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.270
sarahkayongo: I think, posted that link here.

344
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:12.150
Patrick: That's a link. Can you see my screen? No, I'm seeing Google.

345
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:36.269
Abimereki Muzaale: I just see Google watching the video. Someone is watching, looking at the say, I don't think we're looking at the same thing. I'm seeing a Google search screen.

346
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:43.279
Patrick: Okay, I'm stopping sharing now. And I'm going to share again.

347
00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:50.589
Patrick: Okay. yeah. But I I'm I'm not in Google. I don't know. It's showing you Google, you may have more than one screen open.

348
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.889
Patrick: Okay, I'm sharing now.

349
00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:00.740
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you see you're not sharing. You're not sharing

350
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.289
Patrick: book, Tito share? That's what I'm I'm seeing.

351
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, that's correct.

352
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:17.089
Abimereki Muzaale: But that's not the link I sent you, so you'll have to go. Oh, so go down, go down, down down on the left margin.

353
00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:27.020
Abimereki Muzaale: go down, down, go down, go down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Yes, click on that date.

354
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:29.869
sarahkayongo: Yeah, I see. Yeah.

355
00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:39.449
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so yeah, so that's like a one and a half

356
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:44.480
Abimereki Muzaale: but anyway, so so the video.

357
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:59.609
sarahkayongo: the video, the entire process of me producing the video so that's that's that's very good.

358
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:10.910
Abimereki Muzaale: But the instructions are clear. Oh, yeah, II so this idea is, I'm now learning to incorporate them into, as you can tell. This is my mode of communication. Now.

359
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:21.289
Abimereki Muzaale: Microsoft Office, Microsoft, Powerpoint excel. What else is there those for me that Pdf, that's history

360
00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:28.040
Abimereki Muzaale: I communicate through HTML, because HTML is the language of the Internet.

361
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.369
Abimereki Muzaale: I, HTML can handle all kinds of media. You see, I can embed

362
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:39.860
Abimereki Muzaale: video embed anything in HTML. It's designed to take on anything

363
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.309
Abimereki Muzaale: because HTML, and so on is plain text

364
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:59.340
Abimereki Muzaale: but it it with capacity to take on anything. So for me, that's a revolution getting cause. That's that's what I pick from the data science class. They're teaching us machine learning and other things for me, just understanding

365
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:12.579
Abimereki Muzaale: that the Internet is HTML, which is a structure of the web page. Then it's Css cascading, whatever, for you know color. And you know. Gloss.

366
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.020
sarahkayongo: then Javascript for video.

367
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.479
Abimereki Muzaale: This is just lead and each other.

368
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:24.590
Abimereki Muzaale: and that we have Chat Gp, that I can ask for any information, and it gives me

369
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:33.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Gives me feedback, and that I can use Github to Host cause I'm not paying for any of this. Urls right

370
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:52.150
Abimereki Muzaale: website. In fact, website even, is a very all, all concept to me. I create books, which is a richer thing. Right? Yeah. And Github will host them. Of course Microsoft is very happy to give you this for free, because they train their AI on all all your call. Everything is.

371
00:42:52.280 --> 00:43:00.190
Abimereki Muzaale: That's how the AI is a more advanced than anyone, because Github is where people programmers are the whole wall with their code.

372
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:21.220
Abimereki Muzaale: So Microsoft has an advantage. No one else has access to the almost yeah and so they, you know. So they give us free services in return. We give them free data for their training. Their AI. So the AI is called Github

373
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.430
Abimereki Muzaale: co-pilot.

374
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.090
Patrick: It's

375
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.740
Abimereki Muzaale: I pay $10 for it. And when I walk in this environment, let me show you.

376
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:37.830
Abimereki Muzaale: And this in the Microsoft environment. So this is these are things that are definitely coming to to the next version of windows.

377
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.750
Abimereki Muzaale: So this is Vs card. Yeah.

378
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.230
sarahkayongo: So if I'm open.

379
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.600
Abimereki Muzaale: if I open

380
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:51.739
Abimereki Muzaale: a document, say, I use dot IP ui, and that's called

381
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.099
Abimereki Muzaale: Jupiter. This is this is the extension that's finding call out, Yeah.

382
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:57.450
hmm.

383
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:03.799
Abimereki Muzaale: if you start writing code, say, if you start writing code

384
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.990
Abimereki Muzaale: can't think of code

385
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:16.070
Abimereki Muzaale:  it. It was almost the same as the the place. I peste code in collab. That's it, that's it. But you see it completing my code here.

386
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:33.850
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you see, I'm saying, put something called pandas. So I just hit. If I hit Tab it will complete I accept what is completed. Then I go look what suggesting things. So even if you don't know what you're doing. And

387
00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.319
Abimereki Muzaale: and I just go next. Yeah.

388
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:45.809
Abimereki Muzaale: auto completion. That's so. It's called Github call up. It's developed for code. But actually, it also works for text.

389
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:58.759
Abimereki Muzaale: So if I move from. So this is, do you notice that this is the same as Google versus, zoom, yeah. So so I can go back here and just demonstrate. So I think I have this already in

390
00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:03.979
Abimereki Muzaale: I can get so I can put my text here as well to do what? Yeah, to work.

391
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.649
Abimereki Muzaale: No more walk.

392
00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:16.950
sarahkayongo: So they need to be translated into code. It can. So Texas text, yeah, text has nothing to do with with code. But

393
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:25.179
Abimereki Muzaale: does it edit my my text? That's the point I'm trying to make. It was not trained for that, but it has, it has the skills to do. So

394
00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:32.420
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, so, for instance, no, even not asking it, you would just suggest.

395
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.700
sarahkayongo: okay.

396
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:43.079
Abimereki Muzaale: so. So I want to understand. Now I've understood. Github is the host space where you know.

397
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:54.010
sarahkayongo: And then python the language python is the language chat G. Ppt and AI, what's the language?

398
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.979
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, those are different. Ais. So

399
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.749
Abimereki Muzaale: so here. So here the environment, I'm in locally on my computer

400
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:10.660
Abimereki Muzaale: using a extension dot, IPYN, B. That's ipython. Python is PY.

401
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:21.570
Abimereki Muzaale: This is an environment for python, but more than python, because it allows me to run to do Markdown Markdown is where I can just write text.

402
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:28.240
Abimereki Muzaale: The nice thing about text is that instead of working in Microsoft office, for instance. Yes.

403
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.239
Patrick: yeah, I can write. Yeah, I say.

404
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.880
Abimereki Muzaale: essay.

405
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:39.850
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, look at suggesting a topic to me. AI ethics.

406
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:43.180
sarahkayongo: Yeah, you know what? You know, what?

407
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.159
Abimereki Muzaale: Because the last thing I was writing.

408
00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:51.480
Abimereki Muzaale: I was working at AI ethics so, but but

409
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.689
Abimereki Muzaale: so ethics

410
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.429
Abimereki Muzaale: AI ethics.

411
00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.210
Abimereki Muzaale: Look.

412
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.760
Abimereki Muzaale: oops suggesting stuff. So if I the whole paragraph.

413
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.069
Abimereki Muzaale: So just then entire. So if I hit Tab, it's going to accept.

414
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.459
Abimereki Muzaale: So then I move to the next paragraph and continue.

415
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:12.640
Abimereki Muzaale: Now.

416
00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:16.790
Abimereki Muzaale: look, Whoa suggesting.

417
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:24.530
Abimereki Muzaale: So it does not find, it seems almost addictive. One, but not yeah. The address of things was not designed for.

418
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:41.980
sarahkayongo: But I don't have enough content or things to work on. So, my, what do you mean? Content you have, Whoa! You can step from where you are with what you have.

419
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:55.139
Abimereki Muzaale: That's where the you get the most value out of AI is small bits rather than big things. So I just start from scratch together. So what I wanted to show you is that the environment this is my local computer is

420
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.309
Abimereki Muzaale: the same sort of environment on Google call up, yeah.

421
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.140
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

422
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:02.270
sarahkayongo: Yeah.

423
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.800
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, I went to Google jokes.

424
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:12.609
Abimereki Muzaale: The idea that you interspass coded text is the modern, the modern web communication.

425
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:13.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

426
00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:23.499
Abimereki Muzaale: if you want to hide the code. Now, if you look at the file extension, look at the file extension. You see the file extension.

427
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.110
Abimereki Muzaale: IPUN. B. Like Ipython notebook.

428
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.480
Abimereki Muzaale: It's a sem file extension here.

429
00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that's ipine notebook.

430
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:43.240
Abimereki Muzaale: So the name that's a Jupiter book. That's the name. And just paste your code versus text. Howard versus text.

431
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:47.450
Abimereki Muzaale: And what you're looking at here is code and text.

432
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.640
Abimereki Muzaale: If you look at if you look at

433
00:48:53.620 --> 00:49:09.140
Abimereki Muzaale: this resource, yeah. So, for instance, this is text, if I go to the previous page. this is text, yeah, there's no code here. Yeah. So the previous times. Now, I'm updating content to include video.

434
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.179
Abimereki Muzaale: huh? And next, I'm going to add text of our prayer requests.

435
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:20.639
Abimereki Muzaale: Then, if say, we need need a quote for something I'd add quote, that's what's the tiny revolution

436
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:26.399
sarahkayongo: that. How do you? How do you compare this to Powerpoint? Yeah.

437
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:31.309
Abimereki Muzaale: to y dot? Pdf.

438
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.380
Abimereki Muzaale: you can't. There's no comparison.

439
00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.929
sarahkayongo: Yeah. The the beauties.

440
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:54.519
sarahkayongo: the the level of interaction, an integration potentially communication. If if I was to share this by Pdf, by Wad.

441
00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:12.899
Abimereki Muzaale: I love to use email or whatever, then I'll have to send you updates. Oh, here's the latest version. But you have the URL. You have the URL. You just keep using the URL. That's why, Pia said, telling you, oh, that if you're going to lose this link after we end the zoom call

442
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.709
Abimereki Muzaale: well, the link is going to be the same. So you may as well save it somewhere.

443
00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:34.289
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that's what I've done. Yes, because it's going to be the same link next week next year. Yeah, I mean, we can change. But for now that's what's going to be. So for me. Yes, for me. That's my later revolution the main thing is setting up a workflow.

444
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.489
Abimereki Muzaale: That's why I need to do set up a workflow where you're like, okay, now say, if I'm in a meeting, and I want to get notes. Where am I going to type them?

445
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:50.320
Abimereki Muzaale: Or if I'm stay here in this prayer session, where am I going to type?

446
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:54.839
Abimereki Muzaale: If I'm working my, this is where, how will I? How will I

447
00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:03.749
Abimereki Muzaale: type? How will I produce this figure? That's the main idea. Setting up the workflow? How do I get code from Chat Gp.

448
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:18.370
Abimereki Muzaale: and how do I use? Where do I run it for me? My answer, so that as I give you for status Google call up. But I remember but ultimately your goal should be to walk locally. This is not call up. You see, I'm working locally in my computer.

449
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.240
Abimereki Muzaale: Then I push it onto Github.

450
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:36.770
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So so setting up the workflow is once you comfortable with the workflow walking from your computer rather than from online but then pushing the content online you have arrived.

451
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:46.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. But online, I can tell you, if it's easier to walk online. In fact, I'm getting second thoughts about this. If you go to Github.

452
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.830
Patrick: hmm!

453
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.939
Abimereki Muzaale: And then let me just choose a Spjd what's called a repo.

454
00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:57.630
Abimereki Muzaale: And then I go to court

455
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:05.220
Abimereki Muzaale: something called code spaces. I'm going to get something which looks identical to my local computer because it's all Microsoft.

456
00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:16.040
Abimereki Muzaale: It's Vs code on my computer. But look you, said Vs code, this is Vs code on Github identical. Yeah. What I have look has this exact folders

457
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.940
Abimereki Muzaale: it has the same video. Let's see.

458
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:23.659
sarahkayongo: So there, there, no issue between.

459
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.770
sarahkayongo: Wow, there are no issues of

460
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:32.459
sarahkayongo: there are no issues between.

461
00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:55.799
Abimereki Muzaale: generally.

462
00:52:55.830 --> 00:53:11.029
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. But generally, it's easy. Yeah, it's easier working in Mark, I can tell you that. But you can. Of course, this is Microsoft product. Obviously, you can work in Microsoft. But the the things that with Microsoft you have to get a Linux environment.

463
00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:15.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, Matt is automatic is Linux already, automatically.

464
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:22.609
Abimereki Muzaale: But Microsoft, I don't know why they decided to set it up in a non Linux system. Because everything is linux

465
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:39.060
Abimereki Muzaale: in the Internet. I don't see any advantage it has for Microsoft users. It's just pain. And I speak as a person who is doing students who are Microsoft who are windows.

466
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, he was, he was more challenging. Giving them instruction.

467
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.820
because number one challenge, they have to create a Linux environment.

468
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:49.990
Abimereki Muzaale: A shell

469
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:58.860
Abimereki Muzaale: but but look! But look at this. PI wanted to show you that you. I just went to Github and created the same environment. I have locally

470
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.090
Patrick: so it's one way.

471
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:09.969
Abimereki Muzaale: So you see, on on a windows system, you don't have a forward slush. That's a Linux setting. You have a backslash, which is problematic

472
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:21.299
Abimereki Muzaale: you can do, Linux, because that's what the Linux environment and all unix shell commands. For that environment.

473
00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:34.740
Abimereki Muzaale: They won't. We're not working an environment. Well, as far as I've seen with students, I've you. We will not walk in a windows environment like in a command line of windows. If you go and type out unix commands. I don't think they'll walk

474
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:48.480
Patrick: on a on a of course they cannot work in a windows environment exactly yet, but if you want to use the commands in windows. You simply go and and run your your command in in

475
00:54:48.820 --> 00:55:05.559
Abimereki Muzaale: so those are things now, maybe not better, because you've been working in a windows environment. So those are things you don't think of with Mac, because it is in a Linux environment. What's all computers are Linux except Microsoft.

476
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:15.049
Abimereki Muzaale: So I don't. But any. So instead, without worrying about what operating system you're on. if you create a but account.

477
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:26.759
Abimereki Muzaale: you have access to just go to. You see, I went to, I just logged into Github and I went to code and click code spaces. And it created this environment which is identical.

478
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.459
Abimereki Muzaale: You tell me if you can see in my local computer.

479
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:35.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Look, let me put them side by side. You can. They're all Microsoft.

480
00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:38.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Look.

481
00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:51.269
sarahkayongo: you can't.

482
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:55.050
sarahkayongo: So you see.

483
00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:01.809
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. So so this, this is, this is a Vs code on Github. This is Vs code

484
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:09.780
Abimereki Muzaale: on my computer. So same thing in the bottom, right corner in the bottom we have it have a terminal.

485
00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.090
Abimereki Muzaale: Linux, yeah, every time you know.

486
00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:19.229
Abimereki Muzaale: if I type Ellis to see the what directory there it is.

487
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:24.179
Abimereki Muzaale: same here I'm the same folders. Am I in the same folders? Or

488
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.769
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I'm in a sub folder called sips.

489
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, same stuff. Look.

490
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:36.599
Patrick: because all my local com content, I push onto Github.

491
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:49.830
Abimereki Muzaale: So here I've just gone straight to Github. But the content is the same. You see, these are the folders, the 7 folders from 0 to 6, and the one we're using. If I go to 7, one, that's all the prayer, prayer requests and stuff

492
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:52.070
Abimereki Muzaale: from May 2021

493
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:57.220
Abimereki Muzaale: if I go here to 6, 7, one for a request.

494
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.520
Much so same content.

495
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:23.979
Abimereki Muzaale: So I've been working from lo locally to online. That's the I ideal, at least, for now I think it's the ideal workflow where you work locally, then push online. But for as you establish cause, it's a painful process. What pushing from content from locally to github cause you have to use 2 part authentication

496
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:31.669
Abimereki Muzaale: which for me, I have an automatic script that's doing all that. But it was a painful process setting up that process, that automation

497
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:37.729
Abimereki Muzaale: but before you set up that process you can go straight to Github and walk from there.

498
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:47.260
Abimereki Muzaale: So call up is a nice nice landing place. Start with, call up to see how you can copy and paste code from Chat Gpt.

499
00:57:47.300 --> 00:58:09.460
Abimereki Muzaale: When you're comfortable there. Then open a Github account and do something more advanced. Yeah, I have a shell pull up. I think I am ready to move to the next level. Oh, yeah, then then do Github, because with Github, then you have this exact environment which you will later have locally. And you can start using a shell terminal.

500
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:10.620
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah?

501
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:18.409
Abimereki Muzaale: And and also, yeah, anytime, you know. Once this is set up, then you can you be. You'll have set the stage for going locally.

502
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:26.129
Abimereki Muzaale: and the main thing about locally is just convincing your Github account that you're the owner of the account from your computer.

503
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:36.629
Abimereki Muzaale: And that process has been involved. I have a automated script. I can show you. It may not make any sense, but I developed it over a week period of a week

504
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:42.440
Abimereki Muzaale: with Chad. Gpt. Automated script that.

505
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.409
like this script.

506
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:48.810
Abimereki Muzaale: The language, right languages is, yeah, this is Linux or unix.

507
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:52.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, automated. So it gives you this prompt

508
00:58:53.370 --> 00:59:02.970
Abimereki Muzaale: and you may. In fact, the video I made you see me filling out prompts. What's the Github username? What's the repository name? What's the email address?

509
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:07.359
Abimereki Muzaale: Those prompts? They need to run the script because of the inputs required.

510
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:20.659
Abimereki Muzaale: Directory. Are you working on your computer? What's the folder name? What's the these are the keys, the Double Industry Level authentication keys I can show you the sort of passwords which are

511
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.170
Abimereki Muzaale: industry standard

512
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.270
Abimereki Muzaale: like

513
00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.779
is that

514
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:34.909
Patrick: I'm going to arrange to have a separate time with you on this matter.

515
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:48.720
Patrick: Yeah, cause we are going to have to need to pray and then get ready. Or let's do that. Let's do that here to look at. These are my, my private keys that give me access

516
00:59:49.000 --> 01:00:01.020
Abimereki Muzaale: complex, whatever it is. Exactly. So you have. These are called private keys locally in my computer this. It's paired to another key on Github. So that's information

517
01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:05.180
Abimereki Muzaale: to be able to access your github from your computer who squinted fat.

518
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:15.510
Abimereki Muzaale: So that's a thing that that relationship is called Pki public key infrastructure. Where your private key has too much.

519
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:20.210
Patrick: I need us to match your in order for you to be authenticated.

520
01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.580
Abimereki Muzaale: So you call it what?

521
01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:23.680
Pki.

522
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:26.509
Patrick: I need this key infrastructure.

523
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:32.679
Patrick: I need to use this language you're going to.

524
01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:54.869
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you see that completion? The auto completion. Yeah, yeah. Wow. This language for a grant I'm applying for. Because I I'm going small business. Grant, I'm gonna have to create a business this. Grants for business. Small businesses have ideas, anyway. Let's get to pray.

525
01:00:54.950 --> 01:01:02.699
Patrick: thank you. Now, now, if I want to get a grant to help me finish my studies and start a project. What do I do?

526
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:22.199
Abimereki Muzaale: So the Grants generally that I have access to I think I'm aware of, for now offer us citizens and so that so the question of collaboration is a different one, because professors at the School of Medicine at Mulago and School of Public Health have made a lot of money

527
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.539
Abimereki Muzaale: through collaborating with John Hopkins, for instance, who have grants who have access as citizens.

528
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.029
Abimereki Muzaale: So so you can have access

529
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:42.320
Abimereki Muzaale: through collaboration. So those are details. We can think we can explore, since I've never thought in in terms of those lines. But I know, I know, I know.

530
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:43.830
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

531
01:01:44.840 --> 01:02:03.840
sarahkayongo: However, I know my money.

532
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.240
Abimereki Muzaale: By collaborating with John Hopkins, professor

533
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.950
Abimereki Muzaale: who have access. So so the yeah, they're coin their core investigators.

534
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:15.879
Abimereki Muzaale: So well, then, let's see, yeah.

535
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:43.990
Abimereki Muzaale: they're co-investigators.

536
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:49.469
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, this is a generation that's invest 70.

537
01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:52.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Then that's so many.

538
01:02:52.350 --> 01:03:01.610
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Mid seventies. Maybe some. I you see how there's this was really time timing.

539
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:07.380
Abimereki Muzaale: It was HIV, because

540
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.380
Abimereki Muzaale: because HIV, because HIV hit the Us.

541
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.019
Abimereki Muzaale: 1981. Then it was discovered in Uganda.

542
01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.849
sarahkayongo: My video was, oh.

543
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.760
Abimereki Muzaale: so American researchers came from Baltimore 2

544
01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:31.209
sarahkayongo: even even. Larry was one of them. That's western. I remember

545
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.780
sarahkayongo: early nineties.

546
01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:39.050
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So Larry was a John Hopkins people. Actually. Aj.

547
01:03:39.220 --> 01:04:01.779
Abimereki Muzaale: you perfect timing. You guys missed exactly what he's not interested in.

548
01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:09.469
Patrick: Okay, we've been trying to establish. I don't. I don't recognize this right.

549
01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:21.949
sarahkayongo: I'm just on the road

550
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.680
I'm just leaving, and never now.

551
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:26.440
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh.

552
01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:33.060
sarahkayongo: are you supposed to be talking while driving will distract you.

553
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:36.709
Martin Muwaga: You refer to women are the only people who cannot

554
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.320
Abimereki Muzaale: of a

555
01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:03.750
Abimereki Muzaale: the previous

556
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:05.360
sarahkayongo: oh, you guys.

557
01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:14.149
sarahkayongo: I need to be. Oh, my gosh, no, my phone was my laptop was on 86. Now, it's on 6.

558
01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:17.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that's an old, that's an old laptop.

559
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:21.300
sarahkayongo: Yeah, it's it's really it's really old. Now I just

560
01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:26.319
sarahkayongo: use it for things like this. David. Yeah.

561
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.950
okay, I guess you can begin

562
01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.630
Patrick: alright.

563
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:40.110
Patrick: May have already shared with you my prayer request. I need to get out of that zone of anxiety and confusion, and

564
01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:47.299
Patrick: I'm really at the the end towards the end of these things. But ending is so hard

565
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:52.969
Patrick: ending is not as easy as as when you're in the middle.

566
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:57.900
Patrick: It's just like taking off in the plane flying and then landing

567
01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.200
the landing part. My friend

568
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.880
Patrick: wears a lot of skill.

569
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:16.619
Abimereki Muzaale: Need to clean up so much. Have your facts right up, all your details aligned with what must be done. Okay, this this time I'm going share. I'll share the screen as I scribe so that you can. You can mention anything I'm missing.

570
01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:19.170
Abimereki Muzaale: So here.

571
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.370
sarahkayongo: what? What is what

572
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:34.440
sarahkayongo: zone is it? Was it the green z10, me!

573
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:37.210
sarahkayongo: I don't know what I don't know

574
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:42.629
Patrick: which which bring zone. Are you talking about today? So the issue is, you need motivation to.

575
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:53.529
Patrick: I think I think I just need to start working. I need to start walking because I feel a bit daunted.

576
01:06:54.150 --> 01:07:06.960
Patrick: I feel quite daunted. Then, on top of that I am I am praying for, for we continue to believe God to fix my salary. I told you what happened? Did I? Did I share? Yes.

577
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.370
Patrick: yes, I need that salary to be sorted out

578
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:17.169
Patrick:  God has seen us through the holiday amazingly. I'm very thankful

579
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:21.149
cause. Money has been coming in from different sources.

580
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:28.410
Patrick: and that really shows how how great God is, because God doesn't depend on the salary to bless you.

581
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:36.969
Patrick: Yes, I had Martin's birthday. Jay came in in a most miraculous way, and jam really so grateful. He came in and

582
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:43.089
Patrick: said, No, this thing can't flop, because some guys are just taking their time to fix your salary.

583
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:45.649
Patrick: And the thing was sorted

584
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.050
completely, and the young man had the perfect birthday celebration.

585
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.830
Patrick: So God has been providing. And

586
01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:56.849
and I am very, very thankful

587
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:04.699
Patrick: we have gone through these weeks. We have not lacked at all. not locked at all.

588
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:10.369
Patrick: But you know how the devil whispers, do you want in a way that says, Hey, you man.

589
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:15.029
Patrick: they are doing badly. Yeah. But I refuse to.

590
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:22.070
to, to to be there listening to him. So I really pray that I can finish this study.

591
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:26.050
Patrick: I want to get it out of the way, because so much is not happening.

592
01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:31.789
Patrick: So much is not happening because of of the anxiety of trying to finish.

593
01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:33.819
Patrick: It's a very daunting

594
01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:37.630
experience and state and position I'm in right now.

595
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:43.379
Patrick: When I just think of all that I need to do, I feel paralyzed, as Sarah put it.

596
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.189
I feel like I can't move a muscle

597
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.310
Patrick: then of I also thank God so much. D, you know what? Remember when we talked about the blood clot?

598
01:08:52.340 --> 01:09:00.640
Patrick: Yes, yes, yes, and and we we laughed it off, and I said, I'm not gonna see the doctor. Guess what they came for me.

599
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.849
Patrick: Dr. Dr. Mugasha, your friend.

600
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:09.039
Patrick: She she she seized being my friend at that time.

601
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:18.629
Patrick: she insisted the specialist was called in, but so I said, You know what, for the sake of peace let me go, and indeed there's completely nothing.

602
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.129
Patrick: So I have peace with her. I have peace with this specialist.

603
01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:45.109
Abimereki Muzaale: and they checked, and all they found was my muscles had been hot. They've been damaged. That's what I told you. Yeah, I told you professional. After every workout they use ice. They they they protect their bodies from inflammation. The injury that comes from the workout.

604
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.300
Patrick: Exactly. Exactly.

605
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.179
Patrick: Yeah. So I have. I'm now in physiotherapy.

606
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.079
Patrick: and I'm getting better.

607
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.430
The muscles that become like a rock.

608
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.249
Patrick: that they're pulling themselves too hard.

609
01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:06.229
Patrick: So he's doing things using a certain red light, using electricity, using so many interesting things.

610
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.500
I did enjoy the electric shocks.

611
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.530
Patrick: But think that stage is over stimulation.

612
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:17.459
Yeah, it was nasty, but the the muscles have now relaxed

613
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:32.150
these muscles at the back of your knee. They're called calf muscles.

614
01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:38.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, the the cuffs, yes, below, below the back and below.

615
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:45.770
Abimereki Muzaale: and then the sheen, and then on the site. Yes.

616
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:50.500
Patrick: so so. So! When I was explaining what I had gone through after that exercise.

617
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.499
she was laughing and relaxed

618
01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:58.160
Patrick: until I mentioned pain in the cuff muscles. She turned into another person.

619
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Because going because because we have prices

620
01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:07.129
Abimereki Muzaale: that so so so this that's just a red flag for very fear of vascular disease.

621
01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:33.229
Abimereki Muzaale: But for me, as I was telling you, you did not take the boxes, for this is the cause of injury to me is so obvious. It's exercise which even Olympians prevent through ice immersion in my in ice tabs of exercise. So how how appropriate! But but with more information, it was not necessary as you guys. Yeah.

622
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:34.890
sarahkayongo: Hello.

623
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:45.189
Patrick: yeah. But I know know how I'm going to be doing exercise. I'll I'll be gentle at the beginning. I'll not just jump into a very, very highly intense

624
01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:50.520
sarahkayongo: exercise. So you have to stretch also before you. Yes.

625
01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.100
Patrick: exactly.

626
01:11:52.580 --> 01:12:01.960
Patrick: Yeah. Yeah. So I'm thankful to God. Dorothy is in Kampala. Yesterday she got a memo, saying all stuff were on contract.

627
01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.710
to be confirmed!

628
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:10.190
Patrick: So Dorothy is going to get a letter soon, confirming her as

629
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.850
a full time member of staff of the central Bank of the Republic of Uganda.

630
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:25.490
Patrick: So for me, that is a very beautiful, powerful answer the prayer. We've been praying about this, you know. Yeah.

631
01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:30.629
Patrick: And now, you see, when your full time staff, you have cloud, you can talk. You can say.

632
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.189
Patrick: this is what I want. This. I don't want this. You you you talk with more authority.

633
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.439
Patrick: Someone doesn't keep you around. But

634
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.010
Abimereki Muzaale: look at the AI auto completion. Do you see that?

635
01:12:42.600 --> 01:13:08.269
Patrick:  I say good is good. Oh, my God! And we paid for Lisa.

636
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.269
Patrick: Now we we are main with fees for Martin. And

637
01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.699
Patrick: when you recall

638
01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:21.410
Patrick: Nicole, Nicole didn't do well, she's very. She's not interested, that's my biggest

639
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:26.159
Patrick: motivation. She's she's very switched off. She

640
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:33.349
Patrick: but if you say? Let us go out. dress up, we're going out. My God! Do you think this is another person?

641
01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:51.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Basically, what you've described is literally a a graph of green zones, and whatever she is not being challenged, whatever whatever is doing is not more is not, is not motivating her at all.

642
01:13:51.500 --> 01:14:08.269
Patrick: It's not motivating her at all. Yes, so we are now trying to think we need. We will just ask God to lead us what what would really challenge Nicole and make her enjoy her challenge. And yet it translated to income as well.

643
01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.950
That's what we are praying for.

644
01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:16.640
Patrick: cause. This thing of going to school going to class is not her thing at all.

645
01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:18.399
Patrick: Yeah, just not happy.

646
01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:24.649
Patrick: And the teachers have tried for the last 4 years I saw the most dedicated teacher

647
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:29.959
Patrick: reaching a point of feeling very, very frustrated cause. Nicole can show it to you that

648
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:32.169
Patrick: you know you're pushing. But

649
01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:34.899
she she just shows it to that, you know.

650
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:38.780
Patrick: try all you want. But I think I'm not interested.

651
01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.469
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that's so so easy.

652
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:49.650
Abimereki Muzaale: This is very important topic. Because, the question is engagement, you know. Yeah. And she's not engaged clearly.

653
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:51.609
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, definitely, she's in

654
01:14:51.690 --> 01:15:17.439
Patrick: something she likes. She really pushes the bridge. If you say we are going to Dubai tomorrow, and now your room must be. You must have swept. Go and make sure the car is washed. Go and do shopping. Go and do this. My God, she will do everything to that, dot. This is very important diagnosis. She's not engaged.

655
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:31.989
sarahkayongo: and also the incentive, the incentive. Well, I mean. So so that's the challenge of teachers. That's what that's what engagement is to give people motivation.

656
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:41.790
Patrick: Even if you said we are going to Mumbai, just invaded to go and have a weekend with the in-laws and be at the resort. Yeah. My friend.

657
01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:44.669
she would have got

658
01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:59.469
Abimereki Muzaale: so this is a challenge that's mostly directed towards instructors. Because that's a challenge thinking about this thing the whole since I think. June

659
01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.700
Abimereki Muzaale: engaging. How do keep people engaged?

660
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:16.300
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I was thinking about it from reactions for my students, some who are bored, others were anxious. That's how I ended up with that graph because some people the challenges are giving them too much, others, they're too low.

661
01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:23.759
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So the the board. So how do you step up for some students while stepping down for others.

662
01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:32.009
Abimereki Muzaale: My solution. I actually, because I've gotten the clarity of the question is to have 3 different classes beginners intermediate and advanced

663
01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:40.990
Abimereki Muzaale: so so Nicole's issues high structures. Need need to realize that the problems that they're not engaging. Huh?

664
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.650
Patrick: Yeah, true. Yeah.

665
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:49.210
Abimereki Muzaale: That is the big. Yeah. Okay? So that's I've noted that.

666
01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:50.850
Hmm.

667
01:16:51.310 --> 01:17:08.429
sarahkayongo: that's interesting. Because I had a boss, a Vp. Who asked without really fully engaged or being under utilized. That's a very important question and very focused also, yeah.

668
01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:29.449
sarahkayongo: Yeah. And I told him I was being under utilized. And by the end of the week he was thinking of some projects to put me on like, there's been a story of my life for the last, maybe 15 years, and the solution, of course, one solution would have been me to leave

669
01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:50.040
sarahkayongo: but other solution I worked so far. My mentor left. I got disrupted. Now I have to, you know. Have step up I got challenge.

670
01:17:50.040 --> 01:18:03.190
Abimereki Muzaale: I move from the green pastures into the fire. Now my situation is similar to yours felt under utilized, but

671
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:10.800
Patrick: I know that if anything happened and I'm suddenly needed for thorough utilization, I need to also be through this study.

672
01:18:11.170 --> 01:18:13.429
Patrick: You need to avoid me. I miss that bit.

673
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.010
Patrick: I was saying, I felt the way you did

674
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:27.380
Patrick: about being underutilized, and my prayer is to be utilized more. But again I my prayer is that I be utilized after I am through my studies.

675
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:40.290
Patrick: cause once I'm engaged at that level. Now, then, it will jeopardize by completion of these studies. Yet I have very just a few things to do. I'm gonna put my papers together and submit them for for publication.

676
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:47.399
Patrick: Well, very interesting. The language of use.

677
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.569
Abimereki Muzaale: This is your language, Luke. Yeah.

678
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.020
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yeah, those graphs the language of use is essentially

679
01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.740
sarahkayongo: I'm confused.

680
01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:04.520
sarahkayongo: So you want to pray for the green zone to

681
01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:25.780
Abimereki Muzaale: what you mean by after it means father down the ski line? That's what you're saying, because let's say right now you to put in the Red Zone. But if the ski line is pushed. Yeah, yeah, yellow. Does that make sense?

682
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:31.309
Patrick: If? If? Yeah, it does. But you see, the moment I am given work at office.

683
01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.719
Patrick: Then I won't be able to do that. Ph, d.

684
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:42.519
sarahkayongo: Because because you don't build skills with work you're doing. Routine

685
01:19:42.940 --> 01:20:06.480
Abimereki Muzaale: routine does not allow for growth. That's a green zone doesn't need to grow. Growth only comes from the yellow zone. Because you're going to higher challenges, higher challenges, higher skill. The growth of skills is the growth. But the green zone. You're avoiding challenges. So you're just stuck with your skills.

686
01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:15.269
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm avoiding work challenges. But I'm happy to get the school challenges. I'll take them on and I will do them.

687
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:26.759
Patrick: Once these guys start sending me up country giving me assignments that take weeks. That means I've put the books aside and I won't be making progress. Meanwhile graduation day is coming.

688
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.519
Patrick: I want to be on the list.

689
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:39.270
Patrick: I need to be on that list. Yeah, yeah. So I need to really finish that Phd, and

690
01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.229
get it out of the way.

691
01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:43.710
Yeah.

692
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:49.149
Abimereki Muzaale: back at one, as they say back at one

693
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:54.199
Abimereki Muzaale: I need I need I need. And I need to get oh, look what it's saying.

694
01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.280
Abimereki Muzaale: that's the AI, and we do. I need to do the work and get that. This is not too quick.

695
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:02.580
Abimereki Muzaale: This is a look at the air.

696
01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:11.200
Patrick: Can you see how how is that? How is that possible? Because it's it's it's a large language when you're speaking my microphone, or what?

697
01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:16.029
Abimereki Muzaale: No, it's a it's a it's a token. So

698
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:27.509
Abimereki Muzaale: II figured out how AI works, and I checked even on Wikipedia. They're called tokens. So in in gospel. My go. I told you about my gospel music university that I'm studying in

699
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:37.940
Abimereki Muzaale: to play, like a black goes for artists, pianist, so when when it goes for artists, he has a not a melody.

700
01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.130
Abimereki Muzaale: the number of codes.

701
01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:44.440
Abimereki Muzaale: hard probabilities that imagine his head is actually fixed.

702
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:49.339
Abimereki Muzaale: There's a list of codes that can go with that note.

703
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.959
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that's good thinking that II did. I did not have until this class.

704
01:21:54.970 --> 01:22:08.089
Abimereki Muzaale: Of course you know that. Yes, the same melody I'd already been even working on a new Namia variations. Yeah. So yes, I already knew that I could produce different sort of chords for the same song. I knew that already.

705
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.579
Abimereki Muzaale: But in gospel music it's is a fixed number of courts

706
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:20.500
Abimereki Muzaale: like. With this note you can have only 7 optional cards for that one, only 2 for this one only 9.

707
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:24.470
Abimereki Muzaale: So that is also how these models work.

708
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:29.880
Abimereki Muzaale: When you've written something like circus back at one, I need

709
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.170
Abimereki Muzaale: given all these things I've written above. From one up to 10

710
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:35.429
Abimereki Muzaale: it uses information

711
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:43.939
Abimereki Muzaale: based on its this thing has been trained on 1.3 trillion parameters, 1.3 trillion. That's

712
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:48.709
Abimereki Muzaale: more than I don't know thousands of trillion data points

713
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:53.279
Abimereki Muzaale: and so it says, if you have written this 10 points already.

714
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:57.160
Abimereki Muzaale: and I says Sac was back at one. So it just went back to one here

715
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.790
Patrick: and extracted this. That's what I did.

716
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.710
Patrick: It expected that. Yeah.

717
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.760
Patrick: Okay.

718
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:14.980
Patrick: Imagine I did this for my masters, but I'm now seeing it. Practically. I've never done this practically to pass the paper.

719
01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:16.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

720
01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:22.440
Patrick: AI AI is robotics that uses an inference engine and uses

721
01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:24.229
Patrick: a knowledge base.

722
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:34.949
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, this generates is based on heuristics. So that's what is calling tokens other than heuristics.

723
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:44.289
Abimereki Muzaale: That's a structured language. So the structure of language in English is subject. Verb, object.

724
01:23:44.460 --> 01:24:05.429
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. II run to the the grocery store. So I subject run is a verb. Object is the grocery store. All all languages like that, whether it's even computer cord. If you look at any of the codes, there's a subject verb object

725
01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.329
and so models are able to use those heuristics. That's how AI is thriving.

726
01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:22.039
Patrick: That's exactly what it does, exactly what it does. And at that time I didn't really understand. I just got the thing, and then just had to pass the exam.

727
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:26.119
Abimereki Muzaale: Hey? Now I've seen the application

728
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:38.990
Patrick: alright. The I've secured your those other things. So, Sarah, I think

729
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:43.570
sarahkayongo: that graphical illustration was so appropriate.

730
01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:51.559
sarahkayongo: I was kind of in the boredom. It's so so easy for me to get in the boredom the green zone

731
01:24:52.070 --> 01:25:03.259
sarahkayongo: cause. I challenge myself quickly. II get in a high. I finish up project, and then I'm I'm always, actually, always, you know, in the

732
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.719
sarahkayongo: finishing off, and then I hit the bottom. But this time

733
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:11.669
sarahkayongo: I don't know how it happened. A Vp

734
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:23.529
sarahkayongo: very senior person. You know I've written, I think sometime last year I told you guys I'd written a concept, not about process.

735
01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:26.859
sarahkayongo: some improvements and so on.

736
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:30.989
sarahkayongo: and they never had from them. But then

737
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:38.630
sarahkayongo: we had a meeting we had. We had planned several meetings. We never had time until recently.

738
01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.239
sarahkayongo: when the Vp. Was like. Well,

739
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:49.819
sarahkayongo: II think you're one of the people we who are under utilized and would like for you to

740
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:51.859
sarahkayongo: to just

741
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:59.410
sarahkayongo: be more agile, so that we can for you to be a part of other projects.

742
01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:05.800
sarahkayongo: One of the things we offer our company offers is management, consultancy for

743
01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:10.310
sarahkayongo: for governments. and so

744
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:19.589
sarahkayongo: there are opportunities coming up, and Dora is one of them to provide economic development work.

745
01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:30.680
sarahkayongo: I don't know what that will look like, but it may involve some travel down the line and maybe extended. and I'm open to that.

746
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:35.490
sarahkayongo: And then, of course, Ukraine, which seems to be a scramble.

747
01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:38.510
sarahkayongo: These these are trillion dollars

748
01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:45.190
sarahkayongo: that is being you know, the government of Ukraine has put out, and

749
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:49.899
sarahkayongo: and the West every power is really scrambling to really

750
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:59.090
sarahkayongo: find Ukraine's rehabilitation, post-war development. So I'm a part of that. But that one I'm not so

751
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.790
sarahkayongo: him because

752
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:10.429
sarahkayongo: it involves, you know. There, there are so many young people want to go to Ukraine and just put it on their.

753
01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:18.289
sarahkayongo: We are contractors, just like Afghanistan people. There were more contractors in Afghanistan, by the way.

754
01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:23.990
sarahkayongo: more than all the armies combined. There were more American contractors.

755
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:29.419
sarahkayongo: It's business, as usual. I don't want to be in Ukraine for any reason.

756
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:36.880
sarahkayongo: so I'd rather take something like Doha so I'm praying that

757
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:39.899
that materializes into something.

758
01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:42.520
sarahkayongo: Otherwise my

759
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:50.450
sarahkayongo: my request is the same. For national independence, and more

760
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:57.649
sarahkayongo: the ability to come out of debt. I'm actually beginning to intentionally come out of some debts.

761
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:02.440
sarahkayongo: And I I'm positioning myself to.

762
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.649
sarahkayongo: Yeah. There are few dates of paid off.

763
01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:16.459
sarahkayongo: and now I'm ready even to be able to take care of my college student loan, which begins in October. So I pray to God for for vision, for that

764
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.299
sarahkayongo: and for the Ph. D.

765
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:28.649
sarahkayongo: The only college loan I have in life. All my education was sponsored, so I'm grateful.

766
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:37.129
sarahkayongo: And and because and and it it has come at the right time. Because, you know, I finished in 2,020,

767
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:50.040
sarahkayongo: and this administration had just come into power, and one of the key hallmarks for their election was to reduce or cut student loans.

768
01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:58.309
sarahkayongo: So the issue has been debated for 3 years the Republicans have been opposed to it. Yeah.

769
01:28:58.390 --> 01:29:16.660
sarahkayongo: yeah, it has been so for 3 years. We've not paid any student loans. We're just going to be very remarkable even now there's so many opportunities to to even

770
01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:37.729
sarahkayongo: claim some some. So if you don't have a job, you almost don't have to pay right away, and if you want to start paying as little as you can. It's very negotiable, and it was never like that. So I'm grateful for that, and I'm going to apply for a lower repayment

771
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:45.819
sarahkayongo: monthly loan. It's a very important loan, and I look forward to paying it.

772
01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:56.279
sarahkayongo: I pray for Lauren. You know she's doing better mentally. And I were discussing that.

773
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.830
sarahkayongo: And she's.

774
01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:06.089
sarahkayongo: you know, it's a continued prayer for her to stay focused and really think about her future, because

775
01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.299
sarahkayongo: sometimes we have great discussions.

776
01:30:09.850 --> 01:30:17.890
sarahkayongo: She wants to do some courses, and II pray that she stayed that course. But mentally she's doing much better.

777
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:25.120
sarahkayongo: And, Kevin. I'm grateful for him because he's well. I'm grateful to God for what he.

778
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.159
sarahkayongo: Dan. It's alive.

779
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:39.000
sarahkayongo: because this morning he called me excited about news of the possibility. He has an opportunity to start his Master's degree

780
01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.730
sarahkayongo: at the University. North Carolina.

781
01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:48.660
sarahkayongo: And he wants to to do. Actually, he met with the recruiters. He went for.

782
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:55.979
sarahkayongo: Yeah, he went. He went to recruiters. He has some African friends who have inspired him.

783
01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:02.849
sarahkayongo: and so he wants to start as early as next year in January.

784
01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:10.950
sarahkayongo: to do a masters in financial.

785
01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:12.830
sarahkayongo: So I say.

786
01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:28.029
sarahkayongo: and his job actually will pay for it. So I pray that he can be accepted, and that he gets into the program while his job can pay for his Master's degree. Yeah.

787
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:36.650
sarahkayongo: for I pray for good. So for health. I also have an injury. I injured my big foot.

788
01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:43.509
sarahkayongo: Ii don't know this so much pain. I can't wear high heels.

789
01:31:45.150 --> 01:31:48.289
sarahkayongo: I need to go see a doctor.

790
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:52.910
Patrick: Yeah, please do that quickly. And then, put all fears aside.

791
01:31:53.670 --> 01:31:55.760
Patrick: You might need to do some physio

792
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:58.870
sarahkayongo: for my big foot.

793
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:13.369
Patrick: Yeah, it's I is it? Is it around? Oh, big toe. Okay?

794
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:19.699
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, Github, call up, says I, the doctor. Podiatrist.

795
01:32:21.170 --> 01:32:25.559
sarahkayongo: Yeah, II found one. I need to make an appointment.

796
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.100
sarahkayongo: Yeah. Otherwise.

797
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:33.550
sarahkayongo: yeah, for continued protection.

798
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:34.980
sarahkayongo: And

799
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:40.940
sarahkayongo: that's all for me.

800
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:43.620
Patrick: Okay.

801
01:32:43.770 --> 01:32:45.639
Abimereki Muzaale: Jay is Jay back?

802
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:49.179
sarahkayongo: Lost him? Oh.

803
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:56.759
Abimereki Muzaale: okay. So come move to me so. P. I will share. How? How do I share this?

804
01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:00.620
sarahkayongo: Can I share where yours deep?

805
01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:08.589
Abimereki Muzaale: I haven't written them yet. I just wanted to share my screen. How do II don't share my screen. Aren't you to see me?

806
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:10.179
Abimereki Muzaale: How do you do that?

807
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:18.099
sarahkayongo: Can you see me full?

808
01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.570
sarahkayongo: We would.

809
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:24.979
sarahkayongo: Oh, always because I can't see you. I didn't realize you could see me.

810
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.870
sarahkayongo: No, me. I think I was on and off the video. But and he's also back.

811
01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:48.999
sarahkayongo: Well, because you're sharing your screen and we can. But I'm not sharing. Oh, oh, I'm sharing screen. I don't share my screen. So I accidentally right into this, and I don't know how.

812
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:50.700
Abimereki Muzaale: But

813
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:55.320
Abimereki Muzaale: is that? 88 keyboard, 88 notice

814
01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.570
Abimereki Muzaale: holdable. I saw it, and I was like, what

815
01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:05.729
Abimereki Muzaale: and it does $75. That was even more shocking. I was like 77 77 was like.

816
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:09.980
Abimereki Muzaale: this is, I can afford to take a risk with $75.

817
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.080
sarahkayongo: It's

818
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:15.040
Abimereki Muzaale: that's exactly what I'm going to demonstrate.

819
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.889
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, huh! Oh, no, I should have

820
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.099
Abimereki Muzaale: I assumed it still had the charge.

821
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:30.709
Abimereki Muzaale: But just give me a second. Maybe I can plug this in

822
01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:32.629
Abimereki Muzaale: and demonstrate.

823
01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:40.600
Abimereki Muzaale: But for me I couldn't I could not II the concept because III envy, you know, guitarists who.

824
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.720
Abimereki Muzaale: if I just move around the instrument? Yeah, they just move around that instrument anywhere. I'm like.

825
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:50.050
Abimereki Muzaale: you can't do that to the keyboard. You can't do that to the piano.

826
01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.369
Abimereki Muzaale: So this for me is the closest

827
01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:56.670
Abimereki Muzaale: to being like a guitarist catching up with Guitarist

828
01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.369
Abimereki Muzaale: any. Maybe I'll demonstrate some other time. Let me. Oh, okay, I'll plug the

829
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:04.560
Abimereki Muzaale: plug the 10.

830
01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.710
Abimereki Muzaale: Let me see, there's a USB,

831
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:09.590
Abimereki Muzaale: so okay.

832
01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:19.490
Abimereki Muzaale: I mean

833
01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:22.120
Abimereki Muzaale: none of that. And also that has me.

834
01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:25.190
Patrick: So amazing.

835
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.670
Abimereki Muzaale: 75.

836
01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.309
Patrick: Okay? But it's 88 notes. And so the

837
01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.109
Abimereki Muzaale: standard size.

838
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:35.350
Patrick: Okay.

839
01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:38.330
Abimereki Muzaale: There it is. It's on.

840
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.270
sarahkayongo: Wow!

841
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:42.299
Abimereki Muzaale: And I need volume

842
01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.190
Abimereki Muzaale: is that I want to thank God

843
01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:55.660
Abimereki Muzaale: for the S simple things. So so II need to change zoom to original sign for musicians off.

844
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:58.840
Abimereki Muzaale: Hope that's going to. And then this, sir.

845
01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:02.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so I cannot do something like.

846
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.169
sarahkayongo: Oh, it is.

847
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.370
sarahkayongo: I can see

848
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:15.210
Abimereki Muzaale: I need like I didn't bring a lamp here so I can't see. I think I I'm in a wrong voice. Oh, there it is.

849
01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:28.580
Dx. 7. Yeah.

850
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.769
Patrick: that's me, I mean, thank you budget.

851
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.560
sarahkayongo: That's amazing.

852
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:52.999
Patrick: Yeah. So that so this is a for me, this encapsulates affordable 88 keys full

853
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:59.249
for keyboard. Right there, I forgot. Switch off.

854
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.139
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, but that fits

855
01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.550
that fits. I think I forgot to switch this off

856
01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:12.770
Abimereki Muzaale: that fits yeah, that fits in the bag here.

857
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.480
Abimereki Muzaale: So the guitarists are in trouble.

858
01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:31.139
Abimereki Muzaale: So anyway, I think that for the simple things, the simple things for the simple things

859
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:38.689
Patrick: yes, yes, cause now that one I can travel with Uganda, and even live in Uganda.

860
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:57.270
Abimereki Muzaale: It's not perfect. But it's an innovation which was exciting.

861
01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:08.250
sarahkayongo: And she was telling me that how you guys to manage the chairs and whatever.

862
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:12.479
Abimereki Muzaale: So there is an innovation.

863
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:15.679
Patrick: Yeah, so

864
01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:33.890
Abimereki Muzaale: oh, this is, yeah, it's a bit delicate as long as someone, it's not delicate. Actually, it's just The feel is a bit different because the keys are not deep.

865
01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:42.500
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, cause they're very. They're the correct size, but they're flat. So it takes a bit getting used to

866
01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:59.379
Abimereki Muzaale: but it has, it has over 100 voices over 100 bits over 50 demos, I mean, it's for for the, for its cost and convenience. It's really, really, really special. Yeah.

867
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:17.269
Abimereki Muzaale: So so yes, I'm thankful to go for this small things in life. Ai is saying for the ability to work. That's more proper. If I if I was 80 years old, so just say for the foldable.

868
01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:22.959
Abimereki Muzaale: 88. No, look at that completion. Keep you piano

869
01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:44.289
Abimereki Muzaale: because 88 completely piano, because 88. Really, this is not 88 doesn't go with many other things in humanities records. By the piano. Yeah. So this one I'm very excited for, but even another small you may call it simple, but I'm thankful for AI,

870
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.070
Abimereki Muzaale: as Patti knows.

871
01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.830
Abimereki Muzaale: Ai! So far the ais that I've used

872
01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:56.729
Abimereki Muzaale: definitely zoom not some. Then Github.

873
01:39:57.390 --> 01:40:00.100

Abimereki Muzaale: transformational for my workflow

879
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:18.790
Abimereki Muzaale: productivity

880
01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.560
Abimereki Muzaale: in my productivity really, really, really transformational.

881
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:33.090
Abimereki Muzaale: for for for the foldable piano may allow me.

882
01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:35.629
Abimereki Muzaale: may facilitate

883
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:45.069

Abimereki Muzaale:  for me

899
01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:03.530
Abimereki Muzaale: regarding

900
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:09.579
Abimereki Muzaale: use of AI and introduction

901
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:10.969
Abimereki Muzaale: to

902
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:15.930
Abimereki Muzaale: should I call it? It? Yeah.

903
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.070
introduction to it

904
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:21.690
Abimereki Muzaale: and building platforms

905
01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:25.499
Abimereki Muzaale: for work and collaboration?

906
01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:32.339
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so that I think is my my biggest thing this year what's taking my time

907
01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:43.769
Abimereki Muzaale: and what has occupied me fully. And it's also the reason I've not been exercising, because I've been completely absorbed by this. And I'm extremely grateful for this.

908
01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.579
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm really thankful. And

909
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:51.410
Abimereki Muzaale: II couldn't say I couldn't. I couldn't. Yeah, I couldn't say this enough.

910
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:57.519
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so so that. That's that's that's it also thankful for.

911
01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:05.379
Abimereki Muzaale:  I've said this before, but I will say it again for completion.

912
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:12.959
Abimereki Muzaale: All ph d requirements except this is. Oh, look at it completing

913
01:43:13.110 --> 01:43:14.710
Abimereki Muzaale: except this is

914
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:31.699
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm really, really, really, really can't say that again. It's been challenging. Yeah, passing classes, you know in the old days my prayers would will, after being a zone of getting as

915
01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.589
Abimereki Muzaale: but I've been humbled, and my goals have been to pass.

916
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:39.560
Abimereki Muzaale: and I'm not trying to say that. But yes.

917
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:42.240
Abimereki Muzaale: this have been my goals, and

918
01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:48.699
Abimereki Muzaale: the school because of the pandemic allowed

919
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:51.870
Abimereki Muzaale: even required courses to be done for pass fail

920
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:55.890
Abimereki Muzaale: from 2020 this year, they ended.

921
01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:03.030
Abimereki Muzaale: they announced, because the Academic has started last week. They said. They're ending. The past failed. Staff returning to letter grades.

922
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:09.690
sarahkayongo: So I've I've dodged that phase. So my entire Phd, I've been able to do things past fail.

923
01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:21.609
Abimereki Muzaale: and it was very challenging. My goals were to pass my exam. The the classes where, I can tell you it was definitely many of the statistics classes were too advanced.

924
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:27.879
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, and my goal was like, if I need to pass. And I passed.

925
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:32.110
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, the data science class was a little too much.

926
01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:43.750
Abimereki Muzaale: My goal again was to pass. II don't remember praying for an a ever. It has to pass. Yeah. So so for completion of all my requirements.

927
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:47.190
Abimereki Muzaale: That's really, really, really a big deal. Yeah.

928
01:44:47.230 --> 01:44:50.820
Abimereki Muzaale: And now my request?

929
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:58.459
Abimereki Muzaale:  So the first request is that, oh, motivation to do the work.

930
01:44:58.590 --> 01:45:14.280
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, I will take but this audit has got wrong for the fees for the children so this one get back to physical

931
01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:26.690
Abimereki Muzaale: activity. Oh. yes, get back to physics to exercise. There's another one I have. So hip left. Hip injury.

932
01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.390
Abimereki Muzaale: and

933
01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:33.900
Abimereki Muzaale: and say so. Swimmers sinusitis.

934
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:38.429
Abimereki Muzaale: I've inflamed. I've I've inflamed my sinuses.

935
01:45:40.630 --> 01:45:51.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, at first I thought, was Alaji chief, but there's no way I could have had allergies all this month. Haven't swam since May, so I have no reason to have it congested. Noz

936
01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:56.579
Abimereki Muzaale: so I could also be. Rewriting

937
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: could be what

938
01:45:58.330 --> 01:46:02.340
Patrick: Rhinite is a symptom. Rhinite is a symptom of

939
01:46:02.410 --> 01:46:15.209
Abimereki Muzaale: sinusitis, or so Senegal or something. So it's just a symptom. But sinusitis is A a broader is actually an actual diagnosis. No, no, it's inflammation of the sinuses.

940
01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.559
Abimereki Muzaale: Right? Right is the inflammation of the the Noz

941
01:46:19.630 --> 01:46:30.010
Abimereki Muzaale: but the sinuses. And those are in related areas. So yeah, they're related. But the length of time I've had to congested knows is too long for any of these other things.

942
01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.639
Abimereki Muzaale: And when I connected the dots and the fact that I've not swam since May.

943
01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:41.770
Abimereki Muzaale: The injury was done from swimming. I've done nothing but swim since

944
01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.070
April last year.

945
01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:49.349
Abimereki Muzaale: swimming 2 h every day. Don't think there's many human beings that swim that much

946
01:46:49.610 --> 01:46:51.159
Abimereki Muzaale: in chorinated water.

947
01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:56.580
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. And the chlorine is very rough on the on. The sinus is very rough.

948
01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:07.200
Abimereki Muzaale: So II. So this diagnosis only came up with it, maybe yesterday. and it is 2 days ago, and it is revolutionary, because now I've started treatment

949
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:21.600
Abimereki Muzaale: and I can already feel I can smell better. I could. I couldn't smell anything. I was not struggling, smelling anything. I can. I breathe better? Yeah, but I will have to continue the treatment.

950
01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:30.870
Abimereki Muzaale:  for for the foreseeable future. So yes, so I pray, for you know, continued healing of my left injury, so that I can return to jogging.

951
01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:39.780
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm thankful for the Dagnits of similar sinusitis, because that has led to directed treatment. I've been going to a doctor, I'm treating myself

952
01:47:40.090 --> 01:47:42.610
so. I'm ent specialist.

953
01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:49.989
Abimereki Muzaale: If if I'm not clear cured, then I will see a specialist. But for now the rate of improvement suggests that I'll be fine

954
01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:58.830
Abimereki Muzaale: so yes, so so those are those things, then, for growth.

955
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:04.750
Abimereki Muzaale: an expansion of my.

956
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:16.380
Abimereki Muzaale: this one. I not get any chance to share my fenna platform.  I oh, you can see my screen. So yeah, yeah.

957
01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:21.049
Abimereki Muzaale: have I shared? Have I ever shared about this platform? I don't think I have.

958
01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:27.179
Abimereki Muzaale: So there's this one shared. I probably shared with you. So there's this platform

959
01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:37.559
Abimereki Muzaale: I've developed from the summer. It's called. But I'm treating it as Uganda. Yeah.

960
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:47.930
Abimereki Muzaale: this is in in Chinese this, says Mandarin, my trainees, Vincent Jin gave me this. This is this is a means we're all in the same boat.

961
01:48:48.210 --> 01:48:58.500
Abimereki Muzaale: This is a collaborator in California, in Arabic. Translated this, this is one of my trainees it's called Andrew. Arcing is Jewish.

962
01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:01.079
That's his name under arcing

963
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:07.389
he gave me this. He gave me something idiomatic, asked him to give me something idiomatic in Hebrew

964
01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:16.440
Abimereki Muzaale: that encapsulates this. So this is I discussed with Sarah. It's a long story which I won't get into, but I mentioned

965
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:21.669
Abimereki Muzaale: I got cancelled by my students if you know what we cancelled.

966
01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:26.870
but I got counseled by my students. And and the strange thing is, in the last

967
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:32.679
Abimereki Muzaale: 2 years, or even this year, I've been interacting with 9 Johns Hopkins people a lot.

968
01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:42.740
Abimereki Muzaale: So a high school student in Florida called Calvin Matthias approached me and sent me an email in order to to be involved in a research project. I didn't even ask how I got my email.

969
01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:49.529
Abimereki Muzaale: So those are ideas for this platform. This medical student is not at Johns Hopkins is in New York

970
01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:50.840
Abimereki Muzaale: under arcing.

971
01:49:51.130 --> 01:50:01.250
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I'm working 2 projects with him. This is one project. This is why it stands. You can get details on the project

972
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:07.800
Abimereki Muzaale: here. This is called version control and Github. So you can see the history

973
01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:28.670
Abimereki Muzaale: of the document we're working on. The last person to put information. Here was a collaborator called Fawaz Al Amari, but if you click on history it will tell you all. The last update was from Faraz 3 days ago. Then from Andrew 5 days ago, then earlier from me last month. So these are versions. If I click on this.

974
01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:36.759
Abimereki Muzaale: it will take you to the version if I like. Click on this, take you to the version of this document in August 15,

975
01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:55.840
Abimereki Muzaale: or something like that. So it's very. It's a platform that has been used in Silicon Valley, but I'm trying to introduce to to to the medical world, and and as you can see II don't have bounds when I say I'm in education. I'm actually in education.

976
01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:03.850
Abimereki Muzaale: very informal, right? Very informal. Sector. None of these are Johns Hopkins, but of course

977
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:13.560
Abimereki Muzaale: you know the faculty. Who are Johns Hopkins, so I'm going. Not yet introduced this to the Department of Surgery division of transplant surgery. I haven't introduced this to them.

978
01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:15.110
Patrick: but I will.

979
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:17.450
Abimereki Muzaale: And so the platform

980
01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:22.190
Abimereki Muzaale: caters to an individual but gives resources.

981
01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:28.190
Abimereki Muzaale: That allow for for clinical research really is a target. Yeah.

982
01:51:28.290 --> 01:51:33.639
Abimereki Muzaale: clinical research. And of course, the person the services we're providing are for patients.

983
01:51:33.670 --> 01:52:00.500
Abimereki Muzaale: So they the products like, online web apps that allow you to quantify risks a patient in front of you has regarding something you're planning for them or their disease or their surgery. So you should be able to put in the information and an app which we can produce under your profile, safety, profile. You're here if you, if you're ben philosoph

984
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:05.580
Abimereki Muzaale: transplant surgery. So if you know. So once

985
01:52:05.610 --> 01:52:17.969
Abimereki Muzaale: to make a decision, say, he gets a call saying an organ is available, someone just died, and a donor. Does he have any patient who needs this organ? Usually the question is quality of the organ

986
01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:25.129
Abimereki Muzaale: and the number of viruses involved in the quality of an organ, I can tell you. I can give you just a taste of it.

987
01:52:25.190 --> 01:52:27.300
Abimereki Muzaale: You know.

988
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:32.940
Abimereki Muzaale: these are the variables. These are just the parameters. One.

989
01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:54.500
Abimereki Muzaale: Th! This they may not make sense to you. Pr, a, B or group Bmi edge. These are parameters, but in them they even further things. Father Via was involved in a in quantifying the risk. So no human being can process this. In a short time you did. Transplant schedule has to make a decision in within few minutes.

990
01:52:54.500 --> 01:53:03.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Should I accept that organ? So sorry if I said no, the organ is offered to the next transplant generation, maybe in another state like Philadelphia.

991
01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:09.259
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. And so if Ben Philosoph wants to be able to make a quick decision.

992
01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:14.270
Abimereki Muzaale: that would be for the benefit of his patients. So on a wait list. Yeah.

993
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.900
Abimereki Muzaale: So this is Ben. So if he so to be able to produce something that useful

994
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:33.549
Abimereki Muzaale: for faculty. That's also useful, of course, for the target features of patients. But of course we have trainees too. So have things useful for them. And so I'm very excited that I was able to produce this platform.

995
01:53:33.650 --> 01:53:41.239
Abimereki Muzaale: I if you told me that I produced this at the beginning of the year, I'll I'll say that said, that's crazy. Because where was I supposed to get skills to do this?

996
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:44.730
Patrick: Yeah. But

997
01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:55.379
Abimereki Muzaale: the the stars connected aligned. And I did a data science class chat. Gpta arrived. and I drank a lot of coffee.

998
01:53:55.510 --> 01:54:03.510
Abimereki Muzaale: and I was able to use this platform. So yes, so growth and expansion of my fana platform.

999
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:16.610
Abimereki Muzaale:  that's one request, because the bigger platform for me is a social media platform, the more useful it is. Ironically also, the bigger it is, the more it grows.

1000
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:30.569
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So yeah. So actually, I don't know. You should know Flavia. She's a sister of one of your, is she a yif person

1001
01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:46.629
Abimereki Muzaale: Flavia Opio opio for me. So yes, Sasha was here. She was here a few weeks ago, and I saw shared this platform, and her mind went crazy. She was like, Oh.

1002
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:56.490
Abimereki Muzaale: she just started thinking about how I should get in touch with the health sector in Uganda, how a one-stop center

1003
01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:03.960
Abimereki Muzaale: of truth. Say, if a patient, a patient, sees a doctor in Guru, yet he has records from

1004
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.740
Abimereki Muzaale: Carbadio Kampala.

1005
01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:22.659
Abimereki Muzaale: They should be one central place where all these things can be referenced. Yeah. And she was. I was like, that's interesting ideas. And and she was like, Yeah, you seem to be able to to be in the zone of producing such a platform. And I was like, oh.

1006
01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:29.170
Abimereki Muzaale: so what resulted was, oh, I guess I I'm less than sharing my screen.

1007
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:37.819
Abimereki Muzaale: So that's so. I'm I'm thankful. But I'm also praying for growth. What resulted was

1008
01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:41.150
Abimereki Muzaale: me getting a call from her brother-in-law.

1009
01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:43.629
Abimereki Muzaale:  Hi, Ivan!

1010
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:54.009
Abimereki Muzaale: But I haven't really followed up on this, because he called at a time when I couldn't speak. So this is all clinical, all the Us. Mostly the Us. But then, because

1011
01:55:54.600 --> 01:56:01.529
Abimereki Muzaale: of some interactions I had as II created other categories, and I don't know if you know, you know, I even mumble it.

1012
01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:21.469
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I got a call from him. I was like, Oh, he must have been having a chat with flavour, and he was like, yes, yes, yes, so so the platform is already growing, at least this top of it already imaging. But I want guidance

1013
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:30.060
Abimereki Muzaale: and the process of growth and the growth will be successful if it's very relevant to people.

1014
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:58.659
Abimereki Muzaale: And I don't want that to be, because this is it. I don't want there to be any geographic boundaries already. There. None. It's gone beyond Johns Hopkins. But I'm I'm happy to see reaching Uganda cause people like saying, When are you coming back? What are you doing for Uganda? So if this can lead me to do things directly in my area of specialty. For Uganda, I'll be very, very delighted. So that's where I'm praying for growth

1015
01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:04.020
Abimereki Muzaale: expansion of my finap platform. Thin platform.

1016
01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:14.650
sarahkayongo: Just, general. There's a lot you can.

1017
01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:19.389
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, yes, yes, yes, indeed.

1018
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:24.130
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I'm clinical medicine, I know. Clinical medicine. Yes.

1019
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:29.049
Abimereki Muzaale: yes, so so you know. So I'm grateful for these things that should be merged.

1020
01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:32.570
Abimereki Muzaale: And I think that's it, you know. That's it for me.

1021
01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:38.000
Abimereki Muzaale: J. Is not here, so you know. We we shall.

1022
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:43.619
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

1023
01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:45.870
Abimereki Muzaale: a

1024
01:57:45.890 --> 01:58:00.340
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. I is it to be to be a to be? I can't remember. But yes, yes, so.

1025
01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.410
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, yes, I

1026
01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:08.289
Abimereki Muzaale:  Oh, let me post this that you have. You all have access.

1027
01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:09.840
Patrick: Okay?

1028
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:19.699
Abimereki Muzaale: And I can share my screen. Continue sharing that. You see me walking the Linux, I can tell you to think that I walk off a Linux terminal. That's just a whole new world for me.

1029
01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.679
Abimereki Muzaale: and Linux command

1030
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:24.389
Abimereki Muzaale: command line.

1031
01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:36.730
Abimereki Muzaale: So so I have a script which I wrote. which I call II call Abi Kissa. It's a it's a summary of Abi marriage. An ikissa.

1032
01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:44.970
Abimereki Muzaale: It's happy kiss. yeah, I can't show you what the script looks like. It looks like this cut

1033
01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.540
Abimereki Muzaale: get because

1034
01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:50.480
Abimereki Muzaale: it took me a while. I would create a script

1035
01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:55.619
Abimereki Muzaale: lots of interaction with. So that's those are contents of the script.

1036
01:58:56.090 --> 01:58:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: But

1037
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:59.679
Abimereki Muzaale: you'll see it in action.

1038
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:16.500
Abimereki Muzaale: That's exactly why my prayers. I'm giving thanks for AI, because I can tell you II can't recognize myself.

1039
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:36.860
Abimereki Muzaale: I I'm like, what are you? Am I writing a script? Oh, a lot of time, as I can tell you, it shows on my body the body has suffered. Yeah, the body has suffered, has been neglected. Yeah, yeah, the body has been neglected.

1040
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:42.410
Patrick:  But you see, I just do these inputs and the rest is automated.

1041
01:59:43.530 --> 01:59:44.260
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

1042
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.949
Abimereki Muzaale: hey, hey, Nicole?

1043
01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.170
sarahkayongo: Hi, hi, Nicole!

1044
01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.379
Patrick: Hello! I'm not using silo.

1045
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:57.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Hello.

1046
01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:01.660
Abimereki Muzaale: okay, thank you, Ronald.

1047
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:07.710
Abimereki Muzaale: I think she's I think she's I think she has. She's really tall. My God.

1048
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:09.690
sarahkayongo: to

1049
02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:15.310
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. okay, save, you see.

1050
02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:21.629
Patrick: The automation is now on. I've finished the input input parameters. Da da, da all this

1051
02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:38.010
Abimereki Muzaale: and and the keys. Okay, that's fine. III just what I was doing is that posting all the prayers are going to be available within about 1 min on that link I've shared. If you need me to send it again, let me know.

1052
02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:41.919
Abimereki Muzaale: So that's what I was doing. I was just posting them push. So that's what I've done a pushed

1053
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:46.820
Abimereki Muzaale: them to Github. The time the time they used is push. Push them to Github

1054
02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:58.860
Abimereki Muzaale: Github pages, cause that's a pub that's a URL. So within I'm going to check on my side to see when it usually takes 30 s to a minute.

1055
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:02.579
Abimereki Muzaale: Let's see.

1056
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:08.659
Abimereki Muzaale: do we need to to pray. Yeah, yeah, let's let's pray. I'm done.

1057
02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:10.609
Patrick: I'm done.

1058
02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:17.450
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay. Oh, it's available. If you click the link

1059
02:01:18.130 --> 02:01:25.389
Patrick: cause I was doing this so that you can. You have access to this item, though you can read from my screen or your screen, whichever. Yeah.

1060
02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:32.230
sarahkayongo: But you have them also. Just so you know.

1061
02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:45.799
Abimereki Muzaale: if you click on the link, you have them. Cause this is not from my computer, but fine. I'll share. Okay

1062
02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:51.770
Abimereki Muzaale:  the 9.9. No.

1063
02:01:51.910 --> 02:02:02.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Sarah.

1064
02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:10.220
Abimereki Muzaale: I guess. Alright.

1065
02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:15.539
Abimereki Muzaale: Charlie. I'm gonna stop recording. I don't think we need to record the prayer.

1066
02:02:19.190 --> 02:02:22.840
sarahkayongo: Okay, now I need the leaning.
