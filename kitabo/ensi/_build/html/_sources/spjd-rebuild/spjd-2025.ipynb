    "Language and Terminology in Research\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meeting, the participants discussed the use of language in their research and the potential for misinterpretation. They debated the distinction between \"digitization\" and \"digitalization,\" with one participant arguing that the former refers to the introduction of technology, while the latter involves leveraging technology to improve processes and workflows. The group also discussed the importance of taking responsibility for one's work and the potential for language to be fluid and open to interpretation. They concluded that it might be more practical to align with the recommendations of their advisors rather than engaging in a potentially fruitless debate about the correct terminology.\n",

    "Language Consensus in Published Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "Abimereki advised Pat√¨ to not be a purist over language, as there is no consensus on the meaning of words. He suggested that Pat√¨ should not change the meaning of words in their published papers and thesis, and should not have a fight with themselves over this. He also advised Pat√¨ to not change the definition of words in their table of contents, and to not defend their change. He reassured Pat√¨ that no one else would bother them over this, and that Pat√¨ should focus on solving the problem at hand.\n",
