```plaintext
Ukubona LLC is a digital health and data science company dedicated to building decision-support tools for public health and clinical medicine. Its flagship project is a web platform enabling patients, clinicians, and researchers to input demographic and clinical data—via forms, APIs, or voice—and visualize comparative Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

These curves reflect real-time outputs from multivariable Cox regression models trained on datasets such as NHANES, CMS, SRTR, USRDS, and multicenter research cohorts. The platform quantifies risks and trade-offs in scenarios such as kidney donation, using robust statistical architecture and intuitive design.

Ukubona’s strengths include:
- Ecosystem integration with federal datasets and secure workflows
- Open-source pipelines feeding .csv data into modular front-end tools
- Education-forward design for students and early-career analysts
- Stakeholder accessibility, spanning clinical, public, and academic users

Initial efforts focus on supporting the continued work of Vincent Jin, a trained analyst in biostatistics, epidemiology, and health data science, whose expertise is essential to this mission.
