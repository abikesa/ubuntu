sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t know

2
00:00:02.600 --&gt; 00:00:05.030
sarahkayongo: you dumb down everything

3
00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:20.320
sarahkayongo: and making

4
00:00:20.380 --&gt; 00:00:30.219
sarahkayongo: they they can undermine you in a way, because you&#39;re disposable. You&#39;re not that powerful, and you&#39;re crossing level. Yeah, exactly.

5
00:00:30.600 --&gt; 00:00:35.749
Martin Muwaga: But and another thing with these guys who are not raised, though the view way

6
00:00:35.920 --&gt; 00:00:43.579
Martin Muwaga: life only presents binary choices. So if you&#39;re not in the account. you can only be against them.

7
00:00:44.290 --&gt; 00:00:47.769
Patrick Muinda: So it is. That&#39;s how

8
00:00:48.320 --&gt; 00:00:52.050
Patrick Muinda: you have Friday.

9
00:00:52.090 --&gt; 00:01:18.310
Patrick Muinda: Do you have friends that secretaries also cause. Once. I have made friends with them at office, and even out of office. I have one of her closest friends is Dan Rotiva. If you&#39;re not done, rotivo has tried

10
00:01:19.220 --&gt; 00:01:24.739
Patrick Muinda: school is Buddha Buddha, and also the the same fellowship.

11
00:01:24.840 --&gt; 00:01:28.630
Abimereki Muzaale: Hey? So we&#39;re joining. So joining those up.

12
00:01:28.740 --&gt; 00:01:31.759
Martin Muwaga: he took 5. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:32.090 --&gt; 00:01:50.480
Martin Muwaga: So. So you don&#39;t know her because she she&#39;s 1970. You don&#39;t have Coach, Patty. I&#39;m not saying make friends with her friends, I&#39;m saying, make friends with everyone around her from the secretaries, everyone so that they can give you information.

14
00:01:50.660 --&gt; 00:01:55.769
sarahkayongo: And then that one I&#39;ve done. That&#39;s what I have done effectively.

15
00:01:55.930 --&gt; 00:02:19.420
sarahkayongo: And and they they sneak information to me, and II just marvel II marvel. In fact, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I have understood you, sir. First of all, it starts by being overwhelming. That&#39;s the first thing.

16
00:02:19.520 --&gt; 00:02:34.430
Patrick Muinda: You just can&#39;t believe it all. Then, after that you say, Okay, fine. How do I navigate through this. So I begin doing that now. Having chatted, let&#39;s say with Dan, you know now, now she she she can&#39;t tell that I have information.

00:02:34.510 --&gt; 00:02:38.900
and she finally opened up and said, I even told Dan, ABC, ABC.

18
00:02:39.100 --&gt; 00:02:46.400
Patrick Muinda: So now Dan calls me and says, Man, what&#39;s going on we call her number 8, number 8 on eighth floor.

19
00:02:46.500 --&gt; 00:02:53.309
Patrick Muinda: Number 8 is very, very cold to me these days. Talk to her, and she&#39;s not as receptive.

20
00:02:53.440 --&gt; 00:02:56.949
Now see how this thing is now infecting done as well.

21
00:02:57.210 --&gt; 00:03:00.310
Patrick Muinda: So so it is a a game

22
00:03:00.330 --&gt; 00:03:05.319
whereby you need so much energy to play, and I realize that

23
00:03:05.760 --&gt; 00:03:19.589
Patrick Muinda: 1, 1, 1. 1. One thing that must not be discounted is the fact that we should take this thing to God in prayer cause. The the more we use this effort and energy and and brilliance and tact.

24
00:03:19.980 --&gt; 00:03:22.020
Patrick Muinda: the more exhausted we get.

25
00:03:22.240 --&gt; 00:03:27.290
Patrick Muinda: Cause I didn&#39;t see her. She she she also is very. She looks frustrated, and

26
00:03:27.300 --&gt; 00:03:33.340
Patrick Muinda: she just is so walked up by so many things. I think she thinks that I report her directly to the first link.

27
00:03:33.640 --&gt; 00:03:37.050
Martin Muwaga: and and and the that context to very

28
00:03:37.650 --&gt; 00:03:51.309
Martin Muwaga: that context is so important for you guys to understand he&#39;s in that peculiar situation. And and yet I don&#39;t. I&#39;m not even as close to the first lady as she. Well, party perception is real at all.

29
00:03:51.430 --&gt; 00:03:58.810
Patrick Muinda: Everything, everything, everything she&#39;s talking about in meetings I am relaying direct.

30
00:03:59.000 --&gt; 00:04:11.540
Martin Muwaga: so so that one is like befriending an ask.

31
00:04:11.910 --&gt; 00:04:33.350
Martin Muwaga: Yes, very difficult. That lady is a very difficult individual context. She&#39;s a 1970 model pretty much like you no kids, no husband. She lives

32
00:04:33.360 --&gt; 00:04:53.690
Martin Muwaga: so that that that you also have to understand. Because, again, this may sound stuff Gen. Z. People can&#39;t relate with. But these something like when we get these new bosses, and they introduce themselves. And they say, I have 3 kids. They&#39;re all young. This is in their forties. We are like.

33
00:04:54.160 --&gt; 00:05:15.829
Martin Muwaga: she has a instruction. Everyone rejoins.

34
00:05:23.750 --&gt; 00:05:30.310
sarahkayongo: I wanted to share a screen.

35
00:05:30.450 --&gt; 00:05:35.109
sarahkayongo: Janet is 16 13, I think.

36
00:05:35.870 --&gt; 00:05:43.499
sarahkayongo: The story of hey, guys, she&#39;s never mentioned. No one talks about her except that

37
00:05:43.790 --&gt; 00:05:45.810
sarahkayongo: 16. What?

38
00:05:46.280 --&gt; 00:05:50.289
sarahkayongo: Genesis? 1613.

39
00:05:54.350 --&gt; 00:06:05.960
sarahkayongo: So that woman I read different commentary. So basically, it&#39;s a story of the slave woman. Abraham&#39;s that Abraham&#39;s film.

40
00:06:06.050 --&gt; 00:06:14.970
sarahkayongo: Yeah, Ishmael. And then Sarah gets mad and they throw her out, and she goes with the sign, and they don&#39;t know where they&#39;re heading.

41
00:06:15.020 --&gt; 00:06:19.040
Martin Muwaga:  But they really stay. Now, booming. Yeah.

42
00:06:19.150 --&gt; 00:06:34.420
sarahkayongo: which must have been written by a guy, cause that guy says, you see how I put everything so nicely. The guy says.

43
00:06:34.710 --&gt; 00:06:56.340
sarahkayongo: the woman who was sexually abused and and used. And

44
00:06:57.150 --&gt; 00:07:08.339
sarahkayongo: yeah, but can you imagine sexually abuse, and then just left. So anyway. That first, says the Lord who sees me

45
00:07:08.540 --&gt; 00:07:11.489
sarahkayongo: and God God saw her.

46
00:07:11.910 --&gt; 00:07:19.050
sarahkayongo: you know he saw her sorrow, and and he provided more. Yeah, her pain and her sorrow.

47
00:07:19.100 --&gt; 00:07:23.250
sarahkayongo: and he provided water for them in the desert.

48
00:07:23.300 --&gt; 00:07:31.780
sarahkayongo: and he also promised that her son who will be prosperous, and they will become a great

49
00:07:32.250 --&gt; 00:07:43.209
sarahkayongo: and and the reason, you know, I watch so many Netflix things when I watch Dubai blink. Dubai, I&#39;m like, Wow, these people.

50
00:07:43.510 --&gt; 00:07:45.110
sarahkayongo: So wealthy.

51
00:07:45.140 --&gt; 00:08:00.830
sarahkayongo: But you know, it&#39;s because God actually also had a promise for them. So.

52
00:08:01.290 --&gt; 00:08:08.079
sarahkayongo: Isaac, yeah, something else. Isha, Isha Krovin. The Israelites are the covenant ones.

53
00:08:08.090 --&gt; 00:08:19.009
sarahkayongo: but whether you&#39;re coming up or not, but God gave a promise to Abraham, that&#39;s all his descendants, all of them.

54
00:08:19.070 --&gt; 00:08:34.200
sarahkayongo: So so man cries out, and God answers her before she even, and he tells her to look around. And this water, and and they they also got this promise that her children will be prosperous.

55
00:08:34.289 --&gt; 00:08:41.610
sarahkayongo: So she! And then that other comment, she, aol Roy

56
00:08:41.630 --&gt; 00:08:44.800
sarahkayongo: in Hebrew, means the word who sees me

57
00:08:44.840 --&gt; 00:08:49.420
sarahkayongo: so the person she talked to Angel wherever

58
00:08:49.530 --&gt; 00:09:08.140
sarahkayongo: said she was like, Oh, my gosh, you you mean God has seen me, and I&#39;ve seen a message of God. So in in Hebrew they say that, and actually in the entire Old Testament no one has given God a name except her.

59
00:09:08.250 --&gt; 00:09:12.350
sarahkayongo: she called him the good who sees me. aero.

60
00:09:12.910 --&gt; 00:09:23.309
sarahkayongo: so don&#39;t worry. stick to your custody when you&#39;re in the house. When you leave the house, pray for protection.

61
00:09:23.540 --&gt; 00:09:29.229
sarahkayongo: Amen. The house out, out, out in the walk to this

62
00:09:29.350 --&gt; 00:09:43.209
Martin Muwaga: God is on your side, and he sees, I mean for everyone. The the Lord sees us and party, what is what? Yeah, what is? How does your immediate boss? Because your immediate boss isn&#39;t the PS. The undersecretary?

63
00:09:43.510 --&gt; 00:09:46.749
Martin Muwaga: How does she right under the Ps.

64
00:09:47.150 --&gt; 00:09:49.670
Patrick Muinda: Number 2,

65
00:09:49.780 --&gt; 00:09:57.820
Patrick Muinda: the Under Secretary? You should. Did I show you my my appraise? So I thought I oh, sorry I sent you to Durham

66
00:09:57.920 --&gt; 00:10:05.110
Patrick Muinda: when she had finished appraising. May I shared it with breath before, to know the mind of my boss about me and my work? My boss thinks

67
00:10:05.170 --&gt; 00:10:06.739
I am incredible.

68
00:10:07.090 --&gt; 00:10:08.820
sarahkayongo: Oh, delicious! Nice!

69
00:10:09.150 --&gt; 00:10:17.430
Patrick Muinda: She thinks I am not ordinary at all. I do my work. I don&#39;t just do my work. I do it well, and I do it above

70
00:10:17.470 --&gt; 00:10:19.360
Patrick Muinda: and beyond what it should be.

71
00:10:19.400 --&gt; 00:10:38.230
Patrick Muinda: An ordinary person. Be wheelbarrow style. Just go exactly where you&#39;re supposed to go, but II do, I put in extra, and she recognizes that. And she really loves me. When I walk into her office she&#39;s already smiling. She&#39;s laughing. She even when she&#39;s on phone. No, come in, come in. She really really loves me so much.

72
00:10:38.480 --&gt; 00:10:45.809
Patrick Muinda: Now, when it comes to me, her and the overall boss number, because I&#39;m I&#39;m at level 3 in the ministry.

73
00:10:46.220 --&gt; 00:10:50.569
Patrick Muinda: so the other one is CEO. Then comes her, then comes me

74
00:10:50.610 --&gt; 00:10:56.779
Patrick Muinda: my level. So when we are 3, and we are all in the context of work.

75
00:10:57.010 --&gt; 00:10:59.140
I can see my boss also.

76
00:10:59.500 --&gt; 00:11:03.000
Patrick Muinda: just just doing enough to protect me.

77
00:11:03.040 --&gt; 00:11:05.780
sarahkayongo: but not not trying to antagonize

78
00:11:05.960 --&gt; 00:11:16.930
Patrick Muinda: the CEO by showing her that she&#39;s on my side. so I can understand. She also needs to protect her skin. But when we are together she says, no, you know what what just happened there. Ignore it.

79
00:11:17.570 --&gt; 00:11:23.389
sarahkayongo: Continue doing, ABC.

80
00:11:23.800 --&gt; 00:11:35.960
sarahkayongo: But all of you guys, you you&#39;ve all been very successful. God has seen us through up to this stage.

81
00:11:36.130 --&gt; 00:11:37.939
Patrick Muinda: That that is so true.

82
00:11:38.020 --&gt; 00:11:42.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I&#39;ve been transformed very slowly

83
00:11:42.550 --&gt; 00:11:44.030
Abimereki Muzaale: from childhood to now.

84
00:11:44.660 --&gt; 00:11:49.180
sarahkayongo: Been doing very micro evolutions every year.

85
00:11:49.680 --&gt; 00:11:50.590
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

86
00:11:51.230 --&gt; 00:11:52.360
Martin Muwaga: Pete

87
00:11:52.760 --&gt; 00:12:09.660
Martin Muwaga: Khadi. There&#39;s there&#39;s one thing I think I don&#39;t know about, Sarah, but I&#39;ll speak for the men here. I&#39;ve heard from Khadi. I&#39;ve had from Patty, and I can relate it with it, too, at the workplace. I&#39;ve also received feedback from being

88
00:12:09.710 --&gt; 00:12:15.660
Martin Muwaga: about being critical when something is not being done. And I just.

89
00:12:15.750 --&gt; 00:12:20.290
Martin Muwaga: I&#39;ve I&#39;ve also gotten it. So could we? Maybe party probably be a little more.

90
00:12:20.620 --&gt; 00:12:24.500
Martin Muwaga: are aware about this and realize that people&#39;s

91
00:12:24.530 --&gt; 00:12:26.290
Martin Muwaga: people&#39;s ability.

92
00:12:34.460 --&gt; 00:12:40.159
Patrick Muinda: I know that made it clear.

93
00:12:40.990 --&gt; 00:12:46.759
Patrick Muinda: My boss made it very clear, and she says we need to strike a balance between good governance

94
00:12:46.820 --&gt; 00:12:49.840
Abimereki Muzaale: and what politics requires.

95
00:12:49.920 --&gt; 00:12:52.520
Patrick Muinda: I got the point loud and clear.

96
00:12:53.280 --&gt; 00:13:04.260
Patrick Muinda: So she says she&#39;s a Christian. She compromises incredibly incredible compromise, and and I&#39;m not using the other negative words. I&#39;m leaving it at compromise.

97
00:13:04.320 --&gt; 00:13:06.969
Patrick Muinda: She knows how to get her Christianity

98
00:13:06.990 --&gt; 00:13:10.920
Patrick Muinda: and not balance it out. Her beliefs is what what she has to do.

99
00:13:37.080 --&gt; 00:13:51.350
sarahkayongo: You can come off as a mud black woman already. You&#39;re mad, black woman, but I&#39;ve I&#39;ve never, ever ever raised my voice. Actually, it&#39;s funny at work.

100
00:13:51.350 --&gt; 00:14:10.370
sarahkayongo: I just go, you know I just first of all, if it took endless. I want to buy you, get it, and and you know who that do as the workers and the Nan and the talkers. So I don&#39;t argue now, because I know everyone&#39;s working style. After a while

101
00:14:10.390 --&gt; 00:14:35.960
sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t argue. I&#39;m agreeable. So all these terms. Yeah, I&#39;m agreeable. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t give off any 5 of you know. No, no, no! And I understand the boundaries. I understand their little terminologies.

102
00:14:35.960 --&gt; 00:14:46.820
sarahkayongo: and I don&#39;t try to trigger when it comes to deliverables. No one can beat me on on delivering so.

103
00:14:47.030 --&gt; 00:14:54.180
sarahkayongo: And then this little girl&#39;s journey, you and I over would judge, you know, Georgetown, Owen, or too

104
00:14:54.280 --&gt; 00:14:58.959
sarahkayongo:  extra. What&#39;s that? What they use?

105
00:14:59.730 --&gt; 00:15:01.329
Patrick Muinda: to include? Deep?

106
00:15:01.820 --&gt; 00:15:10.979
sarahkayongo: No, they just want their their work, basically, and then they will take it, or they will hear things, you know

107
00:15:11.280 --&gt; 00:15:32.770
sarahkayongo: extra. What&#39;s the word? The terminology? Do you have genesis use exprop pro appropriate. You can work with them on a project, they would take your work and make it theirs.

108
00:15:32.820 --&gt; 00:15:41.470
sarahkayongo: So you have to be careful with them. Is there a way, approach them because they like to Google everything I tell them, and just give them

109
00:15:41.740 --&gt; 00:15:48.530
sarahkayongo: things in general terms. Oh, Sarah, can we meet? And you show us how to

110
00:16:16.330 --&gt; 00:16:32.530
Abimereki Muzaale: but

111
00:16:32.560 --&gt; 00:16:35.100
Abimereki Muzaale: they do it without blinking.

112
00:16:35.220 --&gt; 00:16:36.990
sarahkayongo: Yeah, you can&#39;t even believe

113
00:16:37.410 --&gt; 00:16:41.030
Patrick Muinda: what? Taking on your work and making it yours.

114
00:16:41.100 --&gt; 00:16:42.389
sarahkayongo: Yeah, it does.

115
00:16:42.870 --&gt; 00:17:00.969
sarahkayongo: hey? But then they cannot defend it. So that&#39;s

116
00:17:26.880 --&gt; 00:17:33.600
Abimereki Muzaale: and like, so what are you working on? That&#39;s it. I&#39;m not just that kind of question. Yeah.

117
00:17:33.640 --&gt; 00:17:46.919
Abimereki Muzaale: then, 2 months later, calling II didn&#39;t attend some conference, and a colleague sends me text message from the conference like someone. I just presented this from another institution.

118
00:17:47.180 --&gt; 00:17:54.179
Abimereki Muzaale: probable that at the same time this is improbable topic that II

119
00:17:54.240 --&gt; 00:18:03.300
Abimereki Muzaale: focused on someone that also did it. At the same time, that&#39;s almost impossible. Statistically. yeah, and

120
00:18:03.580 --&gt; 00:18:13.890
Abimereki Muzaale: I knew the idea elsewhere. Hopkins.

121
00:18:13.900 --&gt; 00:18:19.899
sarahkayongo: And I hate to say this, but this one goes up only 9

122
00:18:19.960 --&gt; 00:18:40.019
Abimereki Muzaale: but same.

123
00:18:40.070 --&gt; 00:18:52.950
Abimereki Muzaale: this one is the only person.

124
00:18:53.860 --&gt; 00:18:56.390
Abimereki Muzaale: Wonder why my motivation

125
00:19:20.770 --&gt; 00:19:33.979
sarahkayongo: so for us we walk in the office with your acidity. Cut people don&#39;t talk, and I was like, hey, there&#39;s no small talk, boy, you guys, I guess I know.

126
00:19:33.980 --&gt; 00:19:55.479
sarahkayongo: Oh, I can help you with that, though. Dump their walk on. You kind of you have to create this boundaries? And no, what&#39;s the we have those simple questions, what&#39;s the level of level of effort level

127
00:19:55.640 --&gt; 00:19:57.300
sarahkayongo: that going on?

128
00:19:57.400 --&gt; 00:20:01.850
Martin Muwaga: No, it is, it is. It is a metric for billing.

129
00:20:02.240 --&gt; 00:20:04.179
Abimereki Muzaale: You can&#39;t believe that no

130
00:20:04.410 --&gt; 00:20:05.850
Abimereki Muzaale: like 30%.

131
00:20:06.020 --&gt; 00:20:34.250
sarahkayongo: If if you&#39;re giving me one, my very colleague, senior other fellow technical advisors

132
00:20:34.450 --&gt; 00:20:39.899
sarahkayongo: they want. They wanted to still out talk with them, and then they go to meetings, guys.

133
00:20:40.070 --&gt; 00:21:00.869
sarahkayongo: and they will talk more. And they&#39;re sharing all my ideas, I, and direct it out. You know what happened now, they discovered. Oh, okay, but we can go with all these trips, some of them. You see me going on like in December. This guy I played him. I told him you want. I can help you with this.

134
00:21:01.090 --&gt; 00:21:08.110
But it would take time for me to do that would probably need to go together. Okay, then come.

135
00:21:08.220 --&gt; 00:21:16.739
sarahkayongo: come with me to Kenya and and Ethiopia, and that

136
00:21:16.820 --&gt; 00:21:27.789
sarahkayongo: he what he needed me to help him. So I&#39;m like, no, no, no, the only way I can help you is is if we go to the field office together because I cannot write without evidence.

137
00:21:27.940 --&gt; 00:21:36.000
sarahkayongo: Yeah, yeah, come with me, and then you help me talk to this Kenyan stakeholders.

138
00:21:36.230 --&gt; 00:21:42.780
sarahkayongo: Then we wrote a good report together. But I was not gonna write for him. And then he steals my ideas.

139
00:21:43.260 --&gt; 00:21:45.280
Patrick Muinda: Yeah,

140
00:21:45.520 --&gt; 00:21:47.600
Martin Muwaga: yeah. So yeah, guys.

141
00:21:48.280 --&gt; 00:21:58.679
Martin Muwaga: II know th, this has really been. If you ask, it has really been help, because this is a topic which up applies. But you know one of the things that leads

142
00:21:58.980 --&gt; 00:21:59.780
Martin Muwaga: to

143
00:22:00.290 --&gt; 00:22:08.799
Martin Muwaga: frustration. And you really start feeling you&#39;re in a bad place is when you personalize a situation. What&#39;s happening to you is not peculiar.

144
00:22:09.460 --&gt; 00:22:15.249
sarahkayongo: It is something. It&#39;s. It&#39;s a landscape that we are all having to

145
00:22:15.530 --&gt; 00:22:20.800
Martin Muwaga: to to navigate, but is one of the things that really helps me.

146
00:22:21.250 --&gt; 00:22:31.089
Martin Muwaga: Actually, my reaction is a bit different as not giving you the advice that I follow when I know someone is negative and all that. I do not let them know that I know.

147
00:22:31.150 --&gt; 00:22:40.789
Martin Muwaga: because what happened in the case of party is that when Katy go to land at Rotiva. had had this information, had

148
00:22:40.910 --&gt; 00:22:59.100
Martin Muwaga: provided this information to Patrick she became even more hostile. She&#39;s like this guy now. Must be coming after me full place. So old news about keeping your friends close and your enemies closer that stuff you think, Jay, because

149
00:22:59.280 --&gt; 00:23:06.869
Abimereki Muzaale: being honest sharing when you&#39;re meeting someone for the first time in walk, even me when I met Dory II the first time.

150
00:23:06.950 --&gt; 00:23:23.759
Abimereki Muzaale: I just yeah. But that may not be very strategic. Yeah. So so giving people all in the information they need is something that I never used to consider.

151
00:23:48.510 --&gt; 00:24:01.020
Abimereki Muzaale: But when he comes back

152
00:24:01.020 --&gt; 00:24:03.109
Martin Muwaga: to consider, view his dysfunction.

153
00:24:03.200 --&gt; 00:24:09.159
Martin Muwaga: which skills that did I acquire. I mean a lamb. your lovedness.

154
00:24:09.180 --&gt; 00:24:15.239
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yes. So you know, I got that skill so rich doesn&#39;t have much value in America.

155
00:24:15.520 --&gt; 00:24:31.960
Abimereki Muzaale: But how come? How come that skills. It worked for your dad in the seventies. It ingratiated him so many. I&#39;m unwilling. Iii life for me is not worth living in that position.

156
00:25:00.080 --&gt; 00:25:08.949
sarahkayongo: Yeah, under. That makes it impossible, completely impossible for me to be like him. I can&#39;t.

157
00:25:09.060 --&gt; 00:25:15.110
Martin Muwaga: And his peers get shocked because Elizabeth Murram came and lived next to us in dar es salaam.

158
00:25:15.170 --&gt; 00:25:35.470
Martin Muwaga: So we used to go across with bread for dinner, and should be saying stuff, and I&#39;ll just tell her. She was shocked. Everything, so I can tell that this is I had very. So. I used to be invited around Christmas time to

159
00:25:35.500 --&gt; 00:25:38.170
Abimereki Muzaale: 7 friends places, for

160
00:25:38.430 --&gt; 00:25:45.230
Abimereki Muzaale: you know th, these are no Christians so it doesn&#39;t. Christian music does this holiday music. You had to play music

161
00:25:45.510 --&gt; 00:25:50.029
Abimereki Muzaale: around Christmas time, you know. Ho! Holiday music.

162
00:25:50.540 --&gt; 00:25:54.900
Martin Muwaga: And I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been yesterday.

163
00:25:54.990 --&gt; 00:26:12.859
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s all in reflection is like, Wait a minute. When did the invitation stop? You know every yeah, without fail. But it&#39;s only a reflection. I realize I haven&#39;t been invited some of those events in over 8 to 10 years. I didn&#39;t notice it.

164
00:26:12.960 --&gt; 00:26:22.640
Abimereki Muzaale: But I now know why. No, I mean I know why, because II could tell the nature of the relationship that was naturally.

165
00:26:23.180 --&gt; 00:26:27.870
Abimereki Muzaale: The bones. It was a sort of relationship with Mom&#39;s and Daddy Yup.

166
00:26:27.910 --&gt; 00:26:33.120
Martin Muwaga: zoom Liberals, just like Amara. Yeah.

167
00:26:33.190 --&gt; 00:26:39.110
Abimereki Muzaale: But then tend to realize, oh, this fill up? Yeah, is,

168
00:26:39.250 --&gt; 00:26:41.510
Abimereki Muzaale: does not seem to be position.

169
00:26:41.680 --&gt; 00:26:55.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah, I don&#39;t know my place. Yeah. So there&#39;s an implied hierarchy. And if you acting as if your equals people actually that look all sweet and nice.

170
00:26:55.460 --&gt; 00:26:58.869
Abimereki Muzaale: since to be comfortable, this is to enjoy their relationship.

171
00:26:59.580 --&gt; 00:27:03.750
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, they enjoy it when it&#39;s very clear there&#39;s a hierarchy

172
00:27:28.270 --&gt; 00:27:34.180
sarahkayongo: unless you go somewhere.

173
00:27:34.250 --&gt; 00:28:01.649
sarahkayongo: II had a a former boss in Georgia who would teach me, should say you went to that meeting. Where did someone associate in proximity to this one? So who spoke might check, who&#39;s spoken? Who did this? And and I was like should be no Z. She was teaching me hierarchy. Now for me my situation. Hierarchy became a very. I can remember the day yeah, when I was like, okay, this one. I know what direction I&#39;m going to take.

174
00:28:01.740 --&gt; 00:28:09.620
Abimereki Muzaale: I mean academia. And we&#39;re dealing with science. And when leaders in the area and I&#39;m in a meeting with Dory, one on one.

175
00:28:10.040 --&gt; 00:28:16.509
Abimereki Muzaale: and we&#39;re going over some idea of developing. And that seems to be very important. And

176
00:28:16.770 --&gt; 00:28:25.669
Abimereki Muzaale: we disagree on steady, decided stuff calls trying to show that is a modern democratic person, you know.

177
00:28:25.710 --&gt; 00:28:35.770
Abimereki Muzaale: He calls colleague one of the colleagues that used to invite me for Christmas is John, email.

178
00:28:35.910 --&gt; 00:28:37.570
Abimereki Muzaale: Explain to him

179
00:28:38.220 --&gt; 00:28:44.680
Abimereki Muzaale: the situation you&#39;re in and the 2 defiring ideas. Yeah.

180
00:28:44.760 --&gt; 00:28:58.609
Abimereki Muzaale: And then we&#39;ll choose, because that&#39;s 3, 3. I share this idea, this idea.

181
00:28:58.680 --&gt; 00:29:04.780
Abimereki Muzaale: And as soon as the email goes, there is a very follow up on emails like Abby&#39;s not being clear.

182
00:29:05.170 --&gt; 00:29:08.399
Abimereki Muzaale: Abby says this, and I say this.

183
00:29:09.270 --&gt; 00:29:22.020
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

184
00:29:42.730 --&gt; 00:29:43.790
Abimereki Muzaale: because

185
00:29:43.800 --&gt; 00:29:45.560
Martin Muwaga: it is a sustainable question.

186
00:29:45.680 --&gt; 00:29:54.979
Abimereki Muzaale: what&#39;s the point? I didn&#39;t come from Egango to Baltimore? To

187
00:29:55.260 --&gt; 00:29:59.500
Abimereki Muzaale: to to tell people to explain it. So then let&#39;s say.

188
00:29:59.690 --&gt; 00:30:01.450
Martin Muwaga: yeah, that&#39;s the utmost.

189
00:30:01.780 --&gt; 00:30:08.370
sarahkayongo: There are more standard deviations between market. And

190
00:30:24.290 --&gt; 00:30:29.030
Martin Muwaga: but it started getting darker, and with their chauffeur being kaka.

191
00:30:29.400 --&gt; 00:30:31.109
Martin Muwaga: they had to make a call.

192
00:30:31.630 --&gt; 00:30:38.829
Patrick Muinda: They couldn&#39;t risk making it. But actually lives in Busan. But yeah, sure they couldn&#39;t. They go and stay in Grace Place.

193
00:30:40.830 --&gt; 00:30:46.360
Martin Muwaga: Well, yeah, but that is, that&#39;s that&#39;s true. But II

194
00:30:47.360 --&gt; 00:30:52.430
Martin Muwaga: II do not know. I do not know, Patsy, how the deaddies are still

195
00:30:52.800 --&gt; 00:31:07.090
Martin Muwaga: you you know some of these relationships that he had when he he was chair, and I promise all these cases showed up for your foot years, marriage anniversary. They are going to be

196
00:31:07.450 --&gt; 00:31:14.129
Martin Muwaga: by either way before I forget something. Yeah, I should. It&#39;s good that I bring this up right away. I time is all

197
00:31:14.250 --&gt; 00:31:17.559
Martin Muwaga: the essence. The other day II went to see

198
00:31:18.090 --&gt; 00:31:27.590
Martin Muwaga: that the end, you know, one of the things I dread most after we finish our meetings with, that is, when they are walking us out. Mom usually stays at the door

199
00:31:27.660 --&gt; 00:31:30.939
Martin Muwaga: that it proceeds a little further. The same economy.

200
00:31:31.700 --&gt; 00:31:35.460
Martin Muwaga: and says, You know this, seeing each of

201
00:31:35.610 --&gt; 00:31:47.149
Martin Muwaga: you people the 4 of you. Okuba wonti molecular your money collectively. I really really feel in Timothy Kumbi, sir.

202
00:31:47.350 --&gt; 00:31:52.230
Martin Muwaga: like a welfare pass. This is supposed to be a very personal thing

203
00:31:52.490 --&gt; 00:31:58.130
Martin Muwaga: which each of you bringing to me.

204
00:31:58.650 --&gt; 00:32:07.719
Martin Muwaga: And I was like, okay? And then he says, and and I live in. In. In addition to that, there is this lack of predictability.

205
00:32:07.970 --&gt; 00:32:14.469
Martin Muwaga: Yeah, supposed to show up

206
00:32:14.560 --&gt; 00:32:17.969
Martin Muwaga: with these contributions. II you know the.

207
00:32:18.310 --&gt; 00:32:32.889
Martin Muwaga: So I was like, okay, that it that the bit on the timing. I agree. I think we need to do much better. We can agree on a timeline when we are supposed to be getting this stuff. But as like Daddy, this second bit

208
00:32:32.930 --&gt; 00:32:39.019
Martin Muwaga: whereby you set into we are like giving you some welfare thing. You&#39;re getting one collective thing. I was like dead

209
00:32:39.040 --&gt; 00:33:02.810
Martin Muwaga: perception. II you know, Kadika, this is that I indulge, Daddy. But what I told Daddy is that just look at the alternative reaction here when mommy, because I told him he knows that Patty very publicly use mommy, her contribution habit. I said, when mommy gets hers, mommy, daddy is so grateful. She writes each of us individually, she doesn&#39;t take it.

210
00:33:02.870 --&gt; 00:33:04.159
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So

211
00:33:04.290 --&gt; 00:33:11.639
Martin Muwaga: I say, Daddy, but I apologize if this is how it was perceived. I said, so. What is going to happen is that this lump sum

212
00:33:11.680 --&gt; 00:33:23.340
Martin Muwaga: is going to be split up. and you will receive it individually from everyone, and again goes quiet. Because, I said, the laptop will be split up. It&#39;s like no, no, no.

213
00:33:23.400 --&gt; 00:33:29.819
Martin Muwaga: it doesn&#39;t really have to be a case of splitting up the lumps. And it&#39;s as and when someone wants to

214
00:33:30.820 --&gt; 00:33:56.260
sarahkayongo: to to compile, that&#39;s the point

215
00:33:56.280 --&gt; 00:34:01.869
Martin Muwaga: his hands. The my point over here is that we need to have a date.

216
00:34:02.100 --&gt; 00:34:09.949
Martin Muwaga: We need to have a deep the way we have standing orders for stuff. and we just make sure that we we get this stuff to pee.

217
00:34:10.300 --&gt; 00:34:27.490
Martin Muwaga: you know, because I was so tempted to give him my contribution, but particularly, quite rightly said, no, let Jody hold on to your contribution. Wait for for for all of us to be ready, but II think we should just

218
00:34:27.699 --&gt; 00:34:45.039
sarahkayongo: just locking it. I mean, II apologize for this month, but maybe like

219
00:34:45.070 --&gt; 00:34:46.239
sarahkayongo: teach me

220
00:34:46.440 --&gt; 00:35:05.310
Martin Muwaga: no. And and can you reminded me the 4 of us are all on the same page. Don&#39;t allow, don&#39;t allow that so much peace. It has caused stability, and and we&#39;re some kind of

221
00:35:05.860 --&gt; 00:35:09.810
Patrick Muinda: less reduced reduced tension at all.

222
00:35:10.260 --&gt; 00:35:12.530
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, that&#39;s so nice

223
00:35:12.760 --&gt; 00:35:24.330
Martin Muwaga: for for me, I think. Let&#39;s carry on that we&#39;ve been doing on the same bed.

224
00:35:24.560 --&gt; 00:35:36.239
Patrick Muinda: This is yours. This is from all of us. And mommy, mommy, you&#39;re taking care of everything.

225
00:35:36.290 --&gt; 00:35:42.549
Patrick Muinda: mom, you&#39;re taking care of the food, everything that needs to be done.

226
00:35:43.030 --&gt; 00:35:46.969
Patrick Muinda: And then I tell her things to do with Zafar. You let me know directly

227
00:35:47.270 --&gt; 00:35:52.949
Patrick Muinda: if the car is an issue, you need a new battery. You need this. Let me. Yeah, know.

228
00:35:53.100 --&gt; 00:35:56.169
Martin Muwaga: Let me. Yeah, daddy, this is just for your wedding.

229
00:35:56.270 --&gt; 00:36:01.569
Martin Muwaga: Just keep it. If you don&#39;t need to spend. If you need to go for aircraft. Let me know.

230
00:36:02.520 --&gt; 00:36:26.820
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. By the way, you guys may not know if I tell him, but in addition to that, III cover the utilities that use to cover reading very well

231
00:36:26.820 --&gt; 00:36:33.880
Martin Muwaga: around. I need to have all the money like $240. So it&#39;s not

232
00:36:33.880 --&gt; 00:36:39.910
sarahkayongo: yeah. So so, Le. But you know, rather than having a date.

233
00:36:40.100 --&gt; 00:36:48.419
Martin Muwaga: I would rather have the one which is predictable is the American way of saying it where we so that party will remit the fast Monday

234
00:36:48.460 --&gt; 00:36:56.430
Martin Muwaga: of the month. Something like that. Yeah, that&#39;s the first abandoned

235
00:36:56.490 --&gt; 00:37:02.999
sarahkayongo: cause, you know, for us. We are paid or not. You know how it is bi weekly, and then

236
00:37:03.580 --&gt; 00:37:10.290
Martin Muwaga: paycheck to paycheck. So so I do not know this thing

237
00:37:10.430 --&gt; 00:37:21.170
sarahkayongo: with this thing. Of course it is the end of September thing which we are we are talking about right now. Next week, on Monday or Tuesday you should have mine.

238
00:37:22.210 --&gt; 00:37:24.999
Martin Muwaga: Okay, so can we say Tuesday.

239
00:37:25.450 --&gt; 00:37:33.340
sarahkayongo: II wide a lot of money last week.

240
00:37:33.480 --&gt; 00:37:39.530
Abimereki Muzaale: I believe it&#39;s to how much send Wave kind of allow me to send.

241
00:37:39.940 --&gt; 00:37:43.100
sarahkayongo: I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t do yours.

242
00:37:43.300 --&gt; 00:37:45.550
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, got it, I kind of say, got it

243
00:37:45.820 --&gt; 00:37:53.560
Martin Muwaga: so, Jason, are we? Ca, can we, Sarah? Identitiate? Which date are we saying we&#39;re we&#39;re going to Tuesday.

244
00:37:53.860 --&gt; 00:37:55.999
Patrick Muinda: That is 3 days from now.

245
00:37:56.060 --&gt; 00:37:57.650
sarahkayongo: Yeah, okay, that&#39;s fine.

246
00:37:58.220 --&gt; 00:38:04.700
Martin Muwaga: So, Pete, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll send it. I&#39;ll send you the funds, and and then we agree

247
00:38:04.860 --&gt; 00:38:09.179
Abimereki Muzaale: from there on. Will it be the first Monday?

248
00:38:09.250 --&gt; 00:38:12.339
sarahkayongo: Yeah, that&#39;s fine. It sounds reasonable.

249
00:38:12.570 --&gt; 00:38:18.179
Patrick Muinda: Guys. Remember II you know you&#39;re praying for me about what happened? My salary?

250
00:38:18.310 --&gt; 00:38:26.119
Patrick Muinda: Yes, yes, and that&#39;s why II was not able to contribute effectively last week as only contributing in kind way I could

251
00:38:42.480 --&gt; 00:38:47.779
Martin Muwaga: that amount that that that

252
00:38:47.870 --&gt; 00:38:52.870
Martin Muwaga: let&#39;s chip in for now until that, because we are waiting for you.

253
00:38:53.000 --&gt; 00:39:07.120
sarahkayongo: Thank you so much. Thank you. So so I mean, guys, you don&#39;t know it. But but p. 2 is 75% haircut.

254
00:39:07.350 --&gt; 00:39:20.209
Patrick Muinda: Yes, I&#39;m going by that Scripture, the God that sees me and he&#39;s going to come through

255
00:39:20.290 --&gt; 00:39:26.130
sarahkayongo: you, will you? Will

256
00:39:26.210 --&gt; 00:39:28.389
sarahkayongo: our prayer? Okay.

257
00:39:30.060 --&gt; 00:39:33.970
Patrick Muinda: the same as what I shared the last time?

258
00:39:34.110 --&gt; 00:39:38.470
Patrick Muinda: Of course, the my fish tank. But

259
00:39:38.580 --&gt; 00:39:40.260
it&#39;s the same thing. Yeah.

260
00:39:40.330 --&gt; 00:39:50.029
sarahkayongo: I put a link there so you can see the stuff. JJ, we didn&#39;t get stuff. Oh, yeah, I can share my screen so that you see

261
00:39:51.330 --&gt; 00:39:54.569
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you look in, the there&#39;s a link in the chat.

262
00:39:55.170 --&gt; 00:39:56.979
sarahkayongo: how

263
00:40:10.600 --&gt; 00:40:23.790
Abimereki Muzaale: cause you&#39;re driving from. So we didn&#39;t get so anyway. So there&#39;s a video I think the pass code. I didn&#39;t remember with the pass code. I look for it

264
00:40:23.980 --&gt; 00:40:28.219
Abimereki Muzaale: in case I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think you have time towards the video. But is it video

265
00:40:28.510 --&gt; 00:40:49.199
Abimereki Muzaale: if you want?

266
00:40:49.430 --&gt; 00:40:59.080
Abimereki Muzaale: But otherwise is my self reflection. After I reviewed the students.

267
00:40:59.180 --&gt; 00:41:14.300
sarahkayongo: comments over the last 2 years. Education theory

268
00:41:14.300 --&gt; 00:41:36.539
Abimereki Muzaale: never thought about ever before.

269
00:41:36.540 --&gt; 00:41:45.209
Abimereki Muzaale: but now my mind was so. I like I was not looking for this thing. I ran into them accidentally, this, this is not me. This is under my ideas, therefore psychology.

270
00:41:45.240 --&gt; 00:41:49.860
Abimereki Muzaale: And II ran into them, and I was like, Oh, my goodness, this is it.

271
00:41:50.320 --&gt; 00:41:58.939
Abimereki Muzaale: So? I am the one presenting challenge levels. The material presenting class and students have skill levels.

272
00:41:59.020 --&gt; 00:42:01.039
Abimereki Muzaale: So over time.

273
00:42:01.340 --&gt; 00:42:03.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Say, you&#39;ve said 8 week class.

274
00:42:04.030 --&gt; 00:42:08.060
Abimereki Muzaale: You can think of students coming 0 skills.

275
00:42:08.400 --&gt; 00:42:19.539
Abimereki Muzaale: And so the idea should meet me be that I present skills. Maybe at this level, they may be anxious a little, but II give them tools to allow them to move further down

276
00:42:19.740 --&gt; 00:42:31.090
Abimereki Muzaale: with time. Never thought about, but this is very well.

277
00:42:31.480 --&gt; 00:42:33.529
supported by research.

278
00:42:33.680 --&gt; 00:42:42.740
Abimereki Muzaale: And now, my conclusion actually, is to to have 3 separate classes for people at different levels, because coming at 0,

279
00:42:42.980 --&gt; 00:42:43.850
sarahkayongo: yeah.

280
00:42:44.350 --&gt; 00:42:46.360
Abimereki Muzaale: some people around here.

281
00:42:46.460 --&gt; 00:42:48.620
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you&#39;re giving material, yeah.

282
00:42:48.740 --&gt; 00:42:51.949
Abimereki Muzaale: they&#39;re going to. Actually, that appreciation is very important.

283
00:42:52.130 --&gt; 00:42:53.900
sarahkayongo: that that book.

284
00:42:54.100 --&gt; 00:42:58.309
sarahkayongo: It&#39;s very much what&#39;s

285
00:42:58.330 --&gt; 00:43:02.479
Patrick Muinda: so. So so now I&#39;m offering 3 different classes

286
00:43:02.680 --&gt; 00:43:06.800
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m going to offer 3 different classes. I don&#39;t know how. Get the time.

287
00:43:06.850 --&gt; 00:43:12.109
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, basic and intermediate advanced, so that

288
00:43:13.280 --&gt; 00:43:20.049
Abimereki Muzaale: no one is ever II don&#39;t have representing stuff at this level when someone&#39;s at the level 4, and they&#39;re bought.

289
00:43:20.220 --&gt; 00:43:21.100
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

290
00:43:41.760 --&gt; 00:43:46.030
Patrick Muinda: and then presents us with challenges. And then we all work together.

291
00:43:46.950 --&gt; 00:44:01.959
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s graduate level. But this is a graduate students. But that&#39;s students. And it&#39;s a very diverse group of people from all kinds of backgrounds.

292
00:44:02.010 --&gt; 00:44:20.290
Abimereki Muzaale: So it&#39;s like from the same departments. Some are medical students met that year out of the Phd students in their past year. Some of Mph. Students who Mp. Students almost do nothing because I know I know what Mph. Is. 9 months.

293
00:44:20.470 --&gt; 00:44:28.059
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;ve been exposed to everything in such a compact period. They have no skew, no advance knowledge of anything.

294
00:44:28.250 --&gt; 00:44:41.340
Abimereki Muzaale: So it&#39;s a mix of all kinds of people so it it for me as convinced. You know the deadline for so many new new courses and stuff was in September 30, and as able to do that.

295
00:44:41.690 --&gt; 00:44:51.119
Abimereki Muzaale: Say, that&#39;s what I&#39;m sharing. And I remember pee like this figure. And of course, if you want to copy and paste the code and edit if you can change content.

296
00:44:51.330 --&gt; 00:44:52.690
Abimereki Muzaale: So okay.

297
00:44:52.730 --&gt; 00:44:57.050
Abimereki Muzaale: But anyway, so the stuff is there. And so you said.

298
00:44:57.400 --&gt; 00:45:12.559
sarahkayongo: Still a can you go back to that top. I just want to see mine because the green zone

299
00:45:12.590 --&gt; 00:45:28.510
sarahkayongo: no, I mean I&#39;m still there. But I keep myself. Say, no, work doesn&#39;t stress me. I just as I say, they watch people, and then I know that you know it&#39;s temporary, and we&#39;ll get more work.

300
00:45:28.640 --&gt; 00:45:39.820
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, being in the green zone is a good thing at work. It enables you to do a lot of research.

301
00:45:39.840 --&gt; 00:45:42.290
Abimereki Muzaale: I agree. Yes, I agree. Yeah.

302
00:45:43.060 --&gt; 00:45:44.329
Martin: yeah. I mean.

303
00:45:44.350 --&gt; 00:45:48.950
Martin: I was looking at it mathematically if you just do a straight line, and

304
00:45:49.020 --&gt; 00:45:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: that comes with an angle of 45 degrees for a tangent of one which has

305
00:45:58.290 --&gt; 00:46:12.779
Martin: both both sides, both skill and challenge being at the same level. Anything on either side.

306
00:46:13.020 --&gt; 00:46:16.519
Abimereki Muzaale: People&#39;s one. Yeah.

307
00:46:17.110 --&gt; 00:46:20.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, American sports people call it being in the zone.

308
00:46:20.720 --&gt; 00:46:26.189
sarahkayongo: I heard that in finding Nemo

309
00:46:26.420 --&gt; 00:46:34.700
Patrick Muinda: Zone is where they call snapping.

310
00:46:35.780 --&gt; 00:46:39.839
sarahkayongo: you could stay there long enough.

311
00:46:39.990 --&gt; 00:46:43.859
sarahkayongo: You can snap stressful. This is very stressful place.

312
00:46:43.920 --&gt; 00:46:47.160
sarahkayongo: This is where my students majority of them are.

313
00:46:47.340 --&gt; 00:46:49.149
Martin: Well.

314
00:46:49.270 --&gt; 00:47:01.670
Martin: you should see the old guys in Usaid where we are walking in a Google document. And they create new Google documents and run over stuff. They download it into one.

315
00:47:01.790 --&gt; 00:47:04.309
Martin: What stuff they work offline!

316
00:47:04.370 --&gt; 00:47:08.789
Martin: Then they come back and throw stuff, you know.

317
00:47:08.940 --&gt; 00:47:19.349
Martin: mandatory training, mandatory training. Now, you&#39;re taking a Google documents. Me right now, anyone walking with me has to work with Github.

318
00:47:19.420 --&gt; 00:47:24.529
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s called the version control. So it&#39;s version, this with Silicon valley uses.

319
00:47:24.920 --&gt; 00:47:28.209
Abimereki Muzaale: so that

320
00:47:28.420 --&gt; 00:47:48.180
Abimereki Muzaale: the software takes care of versions because in Google, docs is very confusing. When you see everyone there updating stuff at the same time. But with this one, when you&#39;re doing update, then you write it what&#39;s called a commit message. Say, what changes have made. And that&#39;s the software is able to keep a history of that document over time and all the

321
00:47:48.340 --&gt; 00:47:53.030
Abimereki Muzaale: new additions by every individual over time.

322
00:47:53.190 --&gt; 00:47:55.750
Patrick Muinda: how is your picture now?

323
00:47:56.570 --&gt; 00:48:01.330
Actually, you know what I was about to tell you guys, I haven&#39;t gone to that, doctor.

324
00:48:01.670 --&gt; 00:48:06.580
sarahkayongo: but it&#39;s not painful at all and I can wear use.

325
00:48:06.900 --&gt; 00:48:10.400
Patrick Muinda: So we we went to the overall doctor.

326
00:48:10.440 --&gt; 00:48:16.929
sarahkayongo: Yeah, yeah, I think, you guys, yeah.

327
00:48:17.280 --&gt; 00:48:41.200
sarahkayongo: II did not go. She&#39;s doing well.

328
00:48:41.320 --&gt; 00:48:45.649
sarahkayongo: and then I got up for me a little bit. So

329
00:48:46.010 --&gt; 00:48:56.439
sarahkayongo: coming out of debt. Yeah, this is. This is intentional. So I&#39;m paying back every small and big

330
00:48:56.530 --&gt; 00:48:57.600
sarahkayongo: did.

331
00:48:57.790 --&gt; 00:49:05.420
sarahkayongo: which is my college dates, which is the biggest date I currently have.

332
00:49:05.440 --&gt; 00:49:23.410
sarahkayongo: The Biden administration really came out with all sorts of options for us. If you work for a nonprofit, you can actually have your date. Where? But I don&#39;t work for nonprofit right now.

333
00:49:23.540 --&gt; 00:49:37.309
sarahkayongo: Yeah. So I managed to talk to that loan. You know, you get a loan advisor. And she said, Well, I think you qualify for loan reducement.

334
00:49:37.460 --&gt; 00:49:42.989
sarahkayongo: And so I&#39;m gonna be paying $49 every month.

335
00:50:08.290 --&gt; 00:50:14.270
sarahkayongo: So I&#39;m very grateful for that. And actually, I did that during this

336
00:50:14.370 --&gt; 00:50:22.860
sarahkayongo: this past week, and I had a list of things to take care of, and that&#39;s one of the things

337
00:50:23.230 --&gt; 00:50:35.470
sarahkayongo: so breakthrough. And then I&#39;ve done some interviews. you know God is interesting. Because when I I&#39;m not looking for a job, jobs come to me

338
00:50:35.700 --&gt; 00:50:38.570
Martin: some interviews

339
00:50:38.630 --&gt; 00:50:48.860
sarahkayongo: and they are big jobs that I mean here in the U.S.A. Vp for business development for nonprofit and then but

340
00:50:48.930 --&gt; 00:50:55.560
sarahkayongo: I will leave God, who sees everything.

341
00:50:55.750 --&gt; 00:51:06.760
sarahkayongo: Yeah. And I need, I need, I continue to need a financial breakthrough. So I can complete all my projects, and, you know, prepare for retirement

342
00:51:07.110 --&gt; 00:51:13.430
sarahkayongo: and take care of the kids. So I know he would do something. I&#39;m no longer anxious.

343
00:51:13.550 --&gt; 00:51:16.240
sarahkayongo: So then the first part about

344
00:51:16.300 --&gt; 00:51:18.620
sarahkayongo: about my walk.

345
00:51:18.760 --&gt; 00:51:24.600
sarahkayongo: you know the Vp.

346
00:51:24.960 --&gt; 00:51:26.510
Martin: But talking

347
00:51:26.610 --&gt; 00:51:34.529
sarahkayongo: sees everything he would take care of. He would give me another job where I&#39;m challenged, and and I&#39;m not bored.

348
00:51:34.770 --&gt; 00:51:40.109
sarahkayongo: So I&#39;m grateful that I&#39;m actually where I have time to do other things.

349
00:51:40.200 --&gt; 00:51:43.679
sarahkayongo: Hmm! Which are personal

350
00:51:44.330 --&gt; 00:51:45.860
sarahkayongo: so, and young. Gish!

351
00:51:46.800 --&gt; 00:51:47.630
Hmm!

352
00:51:49.160 --&gt; 00:51:50.479
Martin: That is.

353
00:51:50.680 --&gt; 00:51:58.160
Patrick Muinda: we thank Good so much for what he has done in your life over this one month. Oh, is that it? Almost a month now?

354
00:51:58.240 --&gt; 00:52:01.070
sarahkayongo: God, yeah, God is everything. Yeah.

355
00:52:02.130 --&gt; 00:52:06.460
Patrick Muinda: Now for me. Number one. That motivation came.

356
00:52:06.600 --&gt; 00:52:07.820
I tell you.

357
00:52:08.400 --&gt; 00:52:11.910
Patrick Muinda: done so much work. Yes, it does, is my supervisor.

358
00:52:11.960 --&gt; 00:52:21.609
Patrick Muinda: So she&#39;s given me corrections that I need to implement. So I don&#39;t. II now have a clear direction, and I&#39;m very happy

359
00:52:22.470 --&gt; 00:52:24.520
Patrick Muinda: in the past. I was just

360
00:52:24.740 --&gt; 00:52:29.849
Patrick Muinda: not clear about what I was doing, and I was feeling really really terrible. But now it&#39;s cut out.

361
00:52:30.170 --&gt; 00:52:34.669
Patrick Muinda: scratch out, and I must emphasize this. This didn&#39;t come out strong enough

362
00:52:34.990 --&gt; 00:52:40.040
Patrick Muinda: here. I was ambiguous here. This is very good, so she gave me feedback.

363
00:52:40.640 --&gt; 00:52:52.249
Patrick Muinda: They have lunch today. That feedback is mostly negative. And if it&#39;s positive, then it is, it&#39;s only growing a constant.

364
00:52:52.890 --&gt; 00:52:54.440
Abimereki Muzaale: It is cancer.

365
00:52:54.650 --&gt; 00:52:56.260
Patrick Muinda: It is kazaa. Okay?

366
00:52:56.480 --&gt; 00:52:59.549
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So I think that&#39;s being home.

367
00:53:00.110 --&gt; 00:53:03.970
Patrick Muinda: Then, of course, I&#39;m very thankful to God for the conversation we had.

368
00:53:04.070 --&gt; 00:53:15.609
Patrick Muinda: You have said a lot of what I already knew. It&#39;s just that I did not think that you had gone through it as much as I thought you had, all of you. So for me, that has been such a reinforcement

369
00:53:16.080 --&gt; 00:53:18.250
Patrick Muinda: tonight. Continue towing. But

370
00:53:18.260 --&gt; 00:53:24.710
Patrick Muinda: it&#39;s not personal. Just just to add context to what Jujus said.

371
00:53:25.110 --&gt; 00:53:30.200
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;m not the only one who is having this type of thing with her. It&#39;s not just me.

372
00:53:30.450 --&gt; 00:53:42.490
Patrick Muinda: So yeah, it it is other people. So now I&#39;m tempted, II, to to join into conversations that I tell myself. No, this time I&#39;m not saying anything. I like my lessons from the format boss.

373
00:53:43.140 --&gt; 00:53:46.479
Patrick Muinda: When people come and cry about their frustration about him

374
00:53:46.560 --&gt; 00:53:47.849
I also share.

375
00:53:48.170 --&gt; 00:54:01.999
Martin: but before I know it he knows about it. Then I&#39;m in more trouble. Yes, they extract and burn, mess you up in 4 wheel drive. So in this one I don&#39;t.

376
00:54:02.270 --&gt; 00:54:07.440
sarahkayongo: Someone comes and cries their eyes out. Yeah, I just a month.

377
00:54:07.640 --&gt; 00:54:20.869
Patrick Muinda: I think. Let us trust God to see us through. Let let us let us keep on working hard, and, let&#39;s trust, go to give us victory as we do our work and do it excellently. That&#39;s what I tell them. I no longer say anything now.

378
00:54:21.100 --&gt; 00:54:22.940
sarahkayongo: and and by that has helped

379
00:54:22.970 --&gt; 00:54:28.089
Patrick Muinda: the turbulence in this regime is much less. It&#39;s terrible, but it&#39;s less than

380
00:54:39.770 --&gt; 00:54:43.689
Martin: you talk of those millennials. Drop Genesee

381
00:54:44.430 --&gt; 00:54:50.529
Martin: W. To me the biggest tragedy for them, I think. Well, I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a tragedy. But this

382
00:54:50.730 --&gt; 00:54:56.190
Martin: body of knowledge which is collectively put together, asking my daughters whether they ever read

383
00:54:56.260 --&gt; 00:54:59.480
Martin: textbook. Say, look at me. It&#39;s a textbook

384
00:54:59.780 --&gt; 00:55:25.679
Martin: like those text books that have been put together, which systematically explain the topic they&#39;re like. No, no, no, it is all these puzzles, as we said, of knowledge, Youtube, just quickly. There&#39;s like a same thing. They don&#39;t. They? Just Google, someone explain something. And it&#39;s really, really. And that&#39;s why I was curious when asking the about how many genesis are transitioning into doctor studies because there are no games.

385
00:55:25.810 --&gt; 00:55:35.990
Martin: There is a system

386
00:55:36.100 --&gt; 00:55:39.589
Martin: about to change for them.

387
00:55:39.720 --&gt; 00:55:44.010
Abimereki Muzaale: I can tell you that&#39;s the most brilliant person I might

388
00:55:44.420 --&gt; 00:55:45.140
Patrick Muinda: hmm!

389
00:55:45.530 --&gt; 00:55:51.830
Abimereki Muzaale: The most brilliant person I&#39;ve Metro, or is my master&#39;s in higher? It was my student is Gen. Z. Roughly.

390
00:55:52.010 --&gt; 00:56:17.900
Abimereki Muzaale: I should know. It&#39;s exactly

391
00:56:17.900 --&gt; 00:56:26.880
Patrick Muinda: number 3, number 3, that one God is going to do it, and I want to believe that the next time we meet telling you that the

392
00:56:27.050 --&gt; 00:56:39.009
Patrick Muinda: Public Service Commission has issued my minute, and that Hr. Has fixed the salary and want to believe that that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to be the next time we meet

393
00:56:53.650 --&gt; 00:56:56.000
sarahkayongo: setbacks. Yeah.

394
00:56:56.490 --&gt; 00:57:06.649
Patrick Muinda: then, then, then we also pray for Sarah, I mean for for Dorothy. She&#39;s going to do an American visa interview next week, or is it next week?

395
00:57:07.560 --&gt; 00:57:08.960
1, 20 fourth.

396
00:57:09.750 --&gt; 00:57:15.639
Patrick Muinda: So please remember, we don&#39;t want to lose that money, even if she&#39;s not travelling immediately with her mom.

397
00:57:16.160 --&gt; 00:57:23.309
sarahkayongo: Let her at least have it. If you have your 2 years, you can plan even next year, just get the visa.

398
00:57:23.740 --&gt; 00:57:27.720
Patrick Muinda: So so we are. Thank. We are thankful to hope that.

399
00:57:29.130 --&gt; 00:57:38.630
Martin: And I&#39;m going to. We are having a chat with Dodo. You know these? Us. Embassy interviews invariably take no more than 2¬†min.

400
00:57:38.950 --&gt; 00:57:53.440
Martin: This case with their determination. Right right away. It&#39;s not about land, titles and bank statements and all that. You look them in the eye. Just tell them, hey? I&#39;m here. Abcd.

401
00:57:53.780 --&gt; 00:57:55.749
Martin: and you out are all

402
00:57:57.580 --&gt; 00:57:58.320
yeah.

403
00:57:59.150 --&gt; 00:58:02.829
Martin: that is very true. Who go with Lantitos are kicked out, you know.

404
00:58:02.950 --&gt; 00:58:11.080
Patrick Muinda:  yeah. I once made a mistake, walked in and introduced myself as coming from Ministry of Education, said Minister of Education.

405
00:58:11.100 --&gt; 00:58:12.590
Patrick Muinda: Minister of Education.

406
00:58:12.600 --&gt; 00:58:21.079
Patrick Muinda: She gave me back my passport and said, We&#39;ll get back to you, said you. You don&#39;t need to. You don&#39;t need to to, to, to, to apply again.

407
00:58:22.180 --&gt; 00:58:32.139
Patrick Muinda: You, you! You! You Ja! Just wait! You&#39;ll hear from us. So my friends traveled. I stayed. I eventually got the visa, but after they were returning on when they&#39;re planning to return back from the Us.

408
00:58:32.250 --&gt; 00:58:36.169
Abimereki Muzaale: Why, why is that so, civil servant?

409
00:58:36.910 --&gt; 00:58:48.689
sarahkayongo: II think maybe I should have started that way, and once you come

410
00:58:48.700 --&gt; 00:58:50.810
Martin: for its own personal grounds.

411
00:58:50.950 --&gt; 00:58:56.979
Martin: And it&#39;s yes related like 12 national. Yeah, there should have been a diplomatic note attached.

412
00:58:57.310 --&gt; 00:59:01.919
Patrick Muinda: and yet as going on a private business. So I should not up fronted government.

413
00:59:01.950 --&gt; 00:59:07.590
Patrick Muinda: I learned that. Yeah, I shouldn&#39;t have. I should have just gone in my own right as me.

414
00:59:08.260 --&gt; 00:59:14.760
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So II have learned that. And to be assertive when you&#39;re talking to them, you don&#39;t sound apologetic.

415
00:59:15.040 --&gt; 00:59:21.289
Patrick Muinda: So their their number 5. Jay, thank you so much. Then number 6,

416
00:59:21.450 --&gt; 00:59:25.319
Patrick Muinda: we have gone through the weeks and wanted nothing. That&#39;s the same as today.

417
00:59:25.470 --&gt; 00:59:40.219
Patrick Muinda: The the the issue of number 7. God has done it. My leg continues to only get better. I&#39;m get. I&#39;m completely fine. I&#39;m not even going for physiotherapy anymore.

418
00:59:40.410 --&gt; 00:59:43.839
Patrick Muinda: I didn&#39;t even have to go for anything. I&#39;m just.

419
00:59:44.070 --&gt; 00:59:50.829
Patrick Muinda: The only thing I pray for is the post nozzle, drip thing that I&#39;m having. I&#39;m swallowing too much. So that once was a bit sold in here.

420
00:59:51.050 --&gt; 00:59:56.390
sarahkayongo: It&#39;s a bit irritating, so I might have to get some.

421
00:59:59.070 --&gt; 01:00:14.859
Abimereki Muzaale: II don&#39;t. I think it&#39;s analogic reaction or something where you feel you feel like there&#39;s a tap which is not well close, and you have a running nose. It can run backwards, down, down your throat.

422
01:00:14.950 --&gt; 01:00:17.400
Patrick Muinda: down the throat.

423
01:00:17.500 --&gt; 01:00:21.619
Abimereki Muzaale: I suppose, NASA driven so same conditions. Directions?

424
01:00:21.920 --&gt; 01:00:24.150
sarahkayongo: Yes.

425
01:00:24.390 --&gt; 01:00:38.490
Patrick Muinda: so so. So. I really pray against it. Cause now solving can become painful and UN inconveniencing cause. We are soling all the time the muscle that swallows you can almost feel the must cause I&#39;m solving literally all the time.

426
01:00:38.930 --&gt; 01:00:41.100
Patrick Muinda: So II really

427
01:00:41.160 --&gt; 01:00:46.320
Patrick Muinda: pray against that, and hope that this week I should have proper treatment. Get out of it

428
01:00:46.810 --&gt; 01:00:56.959
Patrick Muinda: then. We, we continue. We thank God for the school fees. Remember, we paid for fees. I tell you, all the fees were cleared. All we have no date.

429
01:00:57.040 --&gt; 01:01:01.850
Patrick Muinda: Wow! Absolutely.

430
01:01:02.620 --&gt; 01:01:10.059
Patrick Muinda: All the children are in school. It&#39;s just unbelievable over 8 million shillings, I&#39;m telling you

431
01:01:10.360 --&gt; 01:01:19.920
Patrick Muinda: so. I thank God so so so much! Nicole is going to school, but she has made it clear that she doesn&#39;t want to go that school anymore.

432
01:01:20.080 --&gt; 01:01:23.709
and she wants to go to another school where she can do things with her hands.

433
01:01:23.850 --&gt; 01:01:27.110
Patrick Muinda: So we&#39;re not good.

434
01:01:27.530 --&gt; 01:01:31.149
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday took her out. We had.

435
01:01:31.300 --&gt; 01:01:33.050
Patrick Muinda: We went out.

436
01:01:33.080 --&gt; 01:01:36.940
Martin: She dressed up well and went out on a date. It was very powerful.

437
01:01:36.950 --&gt; 01:01:38.950
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;ll send you the photos?

438
01:01:39.230 --&gt; 01:01:43.599
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So so we talked and she told me

439
01:01:43.930 --&gt; 01:01:50.919
Patrick Muinda: how she feels. Doesn&#39;t think being with those young babies in that class is really adding any value.

440
01:01:50.990 --&gt; 01:01:53.110
Patrick Muinda: She wants things now.

441
01:01:53.230 --&gt; 01:01:55.860
Patrick Muinda: yeah, very cool.

442
01:01:56.500 --&gt; 01:02:09.169
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So we pray she she gets engaged that that point that that we we get to know exactly what to do and where to go, and that God provides for us.

443
01:02:09.510 --&gt; 01:02:12.990
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. And that one is is

444
01:02:13.470 --&gt; 01:02:21.589
Patrick Muinda: I mean, the last one is more or less done. I pray that that Ph. D. Of will translate into something really really good.

445
01:02:21.650 --&gt; 01:02:24.340
and that finally, that that Ph. D.

446
01:02:24.730 --&gt; 01:02:25.890
Patrick Muinda: Will come.

447
01:02:26.000 --&gt; 01:02:36.940
Patrick Muinda: that I&#39;ll be able to complete it. I had a very great engagement with my supervisor. It was really, really I. She poured herself out from around 8 30 in the morning up to 2 PM.

448
01:02:36.980 --&gt; 01:02:41.629
Patrick Muinda: What she has just on me, no other student just me alone.

449
01:02:42.280 --&gt; 01:02:51.470
Patrick Muinda: So by the end of that I felt so, so, so, so so wonderful! I am so clear in my head about where to go. She gave so many examples

450
01:02:51.680 --&gt; 01:02:59.780
Patrick Muinda: about how other students made it. Those who failed, why they failed, how things should be presented, how things should be as simple as possible.

451
01:02:59.850 --&gt; 01:03:02.019
Lisa should be able to treat my thesis.

452
01:03:02.220 --&gt; 01:03:10.889
Patrick Muinda: and at least get some. Yes, yes, once things are not clear, then it causes my Max to be cut off during examination.

453
01:03:11.700 --&gt; 01:03:13.919
So that is the thing

454
01:03:14.070 --&gt; 01:03:23.990
Patrick Muinda: that is for me now. And of course my boss issues. I really pray that she gets out of my hair. But Scripture says we rest or not against flesh and blood

455
01:03:31.490 --&gt; 01:03:47.249
sarahkayongo: efficient. 10 to 18 every day put on the full arm of God, like, you know, the one for describes. He must have been looking at a Roman soldier. Because.

456
01:03:47.480 --&gt; 01:03:51.869
sarahkayongo: yeah.

457
01:03:52.360 --&gt; 01:04:10.770
Patrick Muinda: so you can see, the whole context is a context of war. It&#39;s a context of non stop warfare. And that&#39;s what we are in as Christians. It&#39;s warfare. Non stop every day.

458
01:04:11.140 --&gt; 01:04:16.079
sarahkayongo: By the way, yeah. So they tell us every day.

459
01:04:16.450 --&gt; 01:04:30.050
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So that is me. I just ask that we pray about that bus issue that God intervenes. It&#39;s a spiritual issue, however much I try to talk to my boss, it will not work, cause I&#39;ve tried. I even went to meet her on a Saturday.

460
01:04:30.190 --&gt; 01:04:35.990
Patrick Muinda: We sat together in a garden. Can you imagine in a garden, when I took her that letter from the first lady

461
01:04:36.190 --&gt; 01:04:39.380
we spoke. We talk. I thought she understood me.

462
01:04:39.890 --&gt; 01:04:43.089
Patrick Muinda: I got coming from Wau

463
01:04:43.120 --&gt; 01:04:48.609
Patrick Muinda: completely. Waste of time, waste of time, if anything, she&#39;s now using it against me.

464
01:04:48.640 --&gt; 01:05:00.990
Patrick Muinda: But you remember that letter you brought me? Well, now, that thing has turned out to be a problem. Now you&#39;re likely to be sucked into it. So get ready to answer, I said. Answer, what couriers don&#39;t answer.

465
01:05:01.270 --&gt; 01:05:05.780
Martin: You don&#39;t ask.

466
01:05:06.320 --&gt; 01:05:29.730
Martin: Well, I think what you what you need to to do it. So you you may need to come with an instrument to, to to sue her spirit. You know, David.

467
01:05:36.350 --&gt; 01:05:45.849
Patrick Muinda: no, just stay away. I don&#39;t report to her.

468
01:05:45.950 --&gt; 01:05:51.160
Patrick Muinda: I don&#39;t need that, so I report to my Under Secretary

469
01:05:51.170 --&gt; 01:05:56.449
Patrick Muinda: if I must respond to something to her through the Under Secretary, who forwards to her.

470
01:05:56.660 --&gt; 01:06:01.269
Patrick Muinda: Hmm, so I don&#39;t need her. I don&#39;t need to be with her

471
01:06:01.380 --&gt; 01:06:07.569
Patrick Muinda: at all. Yeah. So I&#39;m simply going to stay away from her. She&#39;s terrible every time I get close to her.

472
01:06:07.580 --&gt; 01:06:13.060
Patrick Muinda: It is criticism pointing out issues, reminding me of things of the past.

473
01:06:13.100 --&gt; 01:06:15.100
Patrick Muinda: And you you remember this.

474
01:06:15.620 --&gt; 01:06:20.850
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;ve never had that lady sit down with me, and we talk about anything constructive.

475
01:06:20.900 --&gt; 01:06:33.439
Patrick Muinda: how we are going to improve the education sector, how to strengthen. ICT nothing, nothing. It&#39;s criticism, fault finding politics, which is just very toxic

476
01:06:33.600 --&gt; 01:06:36.749
Abimereki Muzaale: it. ICT, really.

477
01:06:37.770 --&gt; 01:06:48.170
Patrick Muinda: yeah, yeah, yeah, there&#39;s so much to talk about. So I think my my strategy now is, stay away, stay in good. and let God do his thing. He knows what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s aware

478
01:06:48.390 --&gt; 01:06:51.979
Patrick Muinda: he knows me. God knows me. He&#39;s aware of what I&#39;m going through.

479
01:06:52.090 --&gt; 01:06:58.419
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;m not being disrespectful. I&#39;m not being abusive. I&#39;m doing my work. I report for duty and do it. Well.

480
01:06:58.550 --&gt; 01:07:04.010
Patrick Muinda: so I think what I&#39;ll do is simply do my work, trust God

481
01:07:04.170 --&gt; 01:07:07.220
and and and stay out of space.

482
01:07:07.650 --&gt; 01:07:12.360
Martin: Only be there. She needs me. but I&#39;ll be available.

483
01:07:12.620 --&gt; 01:07:14.400
Martin: Yeah, be available.

484
01:07:15.830 --&gt; 01:07:17.510
Martin: It will be wealthy.

485
01:07:18.050 --&gt; 01:07:21.620
sarahkayongo: Yeah, it will be. No, you&#39;ll be okay.

486
01:07:21.760 --&gt; 01:07:23.940
sarahkayongo: You&#39;ve been

487
01:07:24.070 --&gt; 01:07:25.670
sarahkayongo: by Jay.

488
01:07:25.930 --&gt; 01:07:26.720
Yes.

489
01:07:26.940 --&gt; 01:07:36.350
Martin: I did have. II didn&#39;t have anything to to share, as you record, but mine is really more of

490
01:07:37.250 --&gt; 01:07:42.959
Martin: Thanksgiving. In September Bria went back to

491
01:07:43.000 --&gt; 01:07:46.080
Martin: to school for her a levels. She&#39;s studying

492
01:07:46.260 --&gt; 01:07:49.370
Martin: mathematics, economics, and literature.

493
01:07:49.880 --&gt; 01:07:54.070
sarahkayongo:  Oh, and

Martin: Getty seems not to have you know she&#39;s gifted. But can you hear me, guys.

498
01:08:19.700 --&gt; 01:08:22.880
Martin: Yeah, gut, Guti doesn&#39;t seem to. I mean.

499
01:08:33.090 --&gt; 01:08:37.709
Martin: yeah, no. Just saying that. Let&#39;s just pray for Gapi to be.

01:08:37.750 --&gt; 01:08:48.880
Martin: you know, to to show more enthusiasm with work. Very gifted girl. But. you know, like bored with stuff, she drifts off in

501
01:08:49.189 --&gt; 01:09:06.810
sarahkayongo: in the in in in this stuff. And then she self diagnosed herself. She says she has Adhd.

502
01:09:06.899 --&gt; 01:09:15.720
Abimereki Muzaale: When does she come?

503
01:09:15.950 --&gt; 01:09:24.969
Martin: Patty pattishes she. Unfortunately she comes back earnest in December. But we that&#39;s not a problem. We can set up a call.

504
01:09:25.620 --&gt; 01:09:26.720

Martin: So apart from that one, let&#39;s pray for for hand, I&#39;ll Gabili.

511
01:10:00.930 --&gt; 01:10:10.000
Martin: I think. Also that group masculine blah blah blah just to to it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a generational thing. But for her to

512
01:10:10.690 --&gt; 01:10:12.050
Martin: to, you know.

513
01:10:12.140 --&gt; 01:10:19.019
Martin: return to her roots, and at least appreciate what is truly authentic and not just.

514
01:10:19.350 --&gt; 01:10:24.819
Martin: Yeah, she should have some kind of filters through which she sees all this feedback she gets from

515
01:10:25.270 --&gt; 01:10:29.930
Martin: from from friends and all that. Let&#39;s just commit. That is very true.

516
01:10:30.160 --&gt; 01:10:42.760
Martin: Yeah, going on really? Well, one of the things that I would like you to

517
01:10:43.070 --&gt; 01:10:44.480
Martin: pray for me.

518
01:10:44.850 --&gt; 01:10:52.920
Martin: There is thorough knows the category of stuff. I belong to its. They are called foreign service Nationals.

519
01:10:53.600 --&gt; 01:10:56.130
Martin: and some of the power

520
01:10:56.420 --&gt; 01:11:05.139
Martin: Samantha Power has recently put in place some new agency initiatives,

521
01:11:05.190 --&gt; 01:11:10.440
Martin: which focus on empowerment of foreign service, national. And so now

522
01:11:10.670 --&gt; 01:11:13.230
Martin: a their husband

523
01:11:13.710 --&gt; 01:11:20.320
Martin: for each of the major departments and bureaus. One of the deputy directors has to be

524
01:11:20.910 --&gt; 01:11:25.969
Martin: a Ugandan. OAOA national, a foreign service national of the country!

525
01:11:26.350 --&gt; 01:11:36.619
Martin: So there! There are some positions that are going to be coming up. And one of them, which I&#39;m looking at, his position of deputy program&#39;s director.

526
01:11:36.880 --&gt; 01:11:46.370
Martin: So they&#39;d be a Deputy health Director health Office director, Deputy Economic Growth Director, but the one end of which I am

527
01:11:46.960 --&gt; 01:11:54.910
Martin: there was a lot of pushback, naturally, from Americans who found it outrageous that you can.

528
01:11:55.260 --&gt; 01:12:05.980
sarahkayongo: foreign service nationals who in Nairobi, literally the offices, 90% Kenyans?

529
01:12:06.070 --&gt; 01:12:13.170
Martin: No, but Kenyans at different level. Those ones are so highly skilled. They run the show. They take no nonsense from the zoom.

530
01:12:13.240 --&gt; 01:12:19.850
sarahkayongo: Their country demands that they should have those top positions.

531
01:12:20.070 --&gt; 01:12:34.160
Martin: and and and my friend told me when you&#39;re going like an American being reassigned to to to Kenya. They they just tell them that. Just stay in your lane. These guys know what they are doing. Your job is not to

532
01:12:34.300 --&gt; 01:12:47.340
sarahkayongo: what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s just, you know, some missions, Kenya. I went to the mission, though. Would you move? Do you merely literally Kenyan.

533
01:12:47.870 --&gt; 01:12:49.579
sarahkayongo: I was so impressed.

534
01:12:49.650 --&gt; 01:12:59.289
Martin: People people know what they&#39;re doing. So let&#39;s pray for that. Breakthrough for the position of deputy programs, director as and when it becomes available.

535
01:12:59.400 --&gt; 01:13:05.259
Martin: This is not really about me per se. But one thing that really

536
01:13:05.280 --&gt; 01:13:12.530
Martin: I keep committing to prayer is my Dad, really, truly, truly, truly, Daddy.

537
01:13:12.850 --&gt; 01:13:18.289
Martin: finding peace, you know. Sometimes we have these conversations like Kadi Gay.

538
01:13:21.360 --&gt; 01:13:26.470
Abimereki Muzaale: II didn&#39;t tell you how that conversation about the

539
01:13:26.790 --&gt; 01:13:27.510
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

540
01:13:29.910 --&gt; 01:13:31.950
Martin: Say that that.

541
01:13:32.470 --&gt; 01:13:41.980
Martin: Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I was like that. You are truly, truly, truly blessed. I&#39;m about to turn 50, and I realize

542
01:13:42.370 --&gt; 01:13:43.810
Martin: you have. You have.

543
01:13:46.820 --&gt; 01:13:50.220
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, your phone is on and off. You don&#39;t know

544
01:13:51.630 --&gt; 01:13:55.650
sarahkayongo: you&#39;re breaking off.

545
01:13:56.020 --&gt; 01:14:01.890
Martin: Yeah, II do not know what&#39;s happening. II think it has something to do with my network, can you?

546
01:14:03.210 --&gt; 01:14:05.760
sarahkayongo: Can you still hear me?

547
01:14:06.530 --&gt; 01:14:09.519
Patrick Muinda: You said he was 45 when he did what?

548
01:14:09.750 --&gt; 01:14:15.059
Martin: No, he was 58 when he became chair apostle PSC.

549
01:14:15.570 --&gt; 01:14:27.570
Martin:  58. Us. And that&#39;s like you have been so blessed, and you held that position. I&#39;ve been told him how we&#39;re waiting, having lunch with

550
01:14:27.820 --&gt; 01:14:33.310
Martin: my father-in-law, Ki Kishuka, and the the Kamundos and the Rakasis, and they were like what

551
01:14:33.430 --&gt; 01:14:39.080
Martin: this guy was chairperson for 16 years. They even shifted to Ro Nakura and said, What did this guy do?

552
01:14:39.580 --&gt; 01:14:49.870
Martin: Who, you know? He&#39;s not part of the guys who made the sacrifices. He had been there for a long time for 10 years, because he had broken the U Cb. Bank for

553
01:14:50.120 --&gt; 01:14:51.220
Martin: the rib boots.

554
01:14:51.520 --&gt; 01:14:58.669
Martin: you know. Sounds like that. You&#39;ve been blessed like this, but has like that changing of the mind. I some. I sometimes find it

555
01:14:58.870 --&gt; 01:15:01.650
Martin: upsetting. Khadi says that I indulge him.

556
01:15:01.880 --&gt; 01:15:16.650
Martin: but you started off by saying he needs peace, so he&#39;s not peaceful about that, or he&#39;s not appreciative. Or let me. You guys know what I&#39;m talking about that the post

557
01:15:17.710 --&gt; 01:15:19.460
sarahkayongo: are complaining.

558
01:15:21.940 --&gt; 01:15:24.949
Martin: No, not really forget.

559
01:15:26.830 --&gt; 01:15:30.910
Martin: But party is gratitude an issue of memory, or is it a mindset?

560
01:15:32.170 --&gt; 01:15:32.870
Martin: Hmm!

561
01:15:33.320 --&gt; 01:15:37.799
sarahkayongo: We need to be reminded sometimes, and I&#39;m reminded of what it has done for me.

562
01:15:37.850 --&gt; 01:15:40.510
Patrick Muinda: It it puts me back on track.

563
01:15:40.990 --&gt; 01:15:50.080
Patrick Muinda: In fact, I become humble and even repent and say, God forgive me for what I&#39;ve been thinking and say, sometimes you just need to be reminded.

564
01:15:51.410 --&gt; 01:15:58.390
sarahkayongo: oh, yeah, that&#39;s so good, that is so good. But anyway, ask why?

565
01:15:58.940 --&gt; 01:16:01.760
Martin: You may ask where I brought this up, but

566
01:16:01.850 --&gt; 01:16:03.820
Martin: but it&#39;s upsetting. Yeah.

567
01:16:04.180 --&gt; 01:16:11.950
Martin: I brought it up because it&#39;s upsetting it. It sometimes gets, and we are always going round and round and round and round.

568
01:16:12.190 --&gt; 01:16:14.230
Martin: Yes.

569
01:16:14.420 --&gt; 01:16:25.640
Martin: IIII told Kadi that when the dead is went to the village for some time. It was like I got a bit of a breath as like, Oh, you know it can&#39;t drain you. You get to have your 4, 5 days.

570
01:16:36.310 --&gt; 01:16:48.010
sarahkayongo: because I would sit there and moan about this and complain.

571
01:16:48.100 --&gt; 01:16:58.220
sarahkayongo: Yeah, III see that unfortunately, I see where this is coming from. I told you months ago.

572
01:16:58.650 --&gt; 01:16:59.490
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh.

573
01:17:00.570 --&gt; 01:17:07.440
Martin: yeah, so that is not mine peculiar to me. It affects me quite a bit, but I think it&#39;s a prayer for all of us.

574
01:17:07.620 --&gt; 01:17:10.610
Patrick Muinda: Just leave it under you. Yeah.

575
01:17:10.820 --&gt; 01:17:17.590
Martin: Yeah. And finally, Brenda, let&#39;s keep praying for Brenda. You know she&#39;s so far away.

576
01:17:18.150 --&gt; 01:17:26.260
Martin: But at first, the first time I arrived in Sierra Leone. Just the sheer trouble that it&#39;s like a whole day&#39;s

577
01:17:26.370 --&gt; 01:17:39.630
Martin: trouble is like, really. What what the hell are you doing? Is this really what life is about that someone goes halfway across the world. But Brenda is enjoying her work. She&#39;s coming into her own.

578
01:17:39.950 --&gt; 01:17:46.569
Martin: This is a much more senior position. She&#39;s the chief of nutrition. There

579
01:17:46.590 --&gt; 01:17:50.219
Martin: we are. We are praying for a breakthrough for how to get.

580
01:17:50.890 --&gt; 01:17:56.830
Martin: You know Cyril Leone is an unfamiliar duty station, so she can start applying after a Yah!

581
01:17:57.160 --&gt; 01:17:58.610
Martin: We&#39;re not the

582
01:17:58.800 --&gt; 01:18:05.060
Martin: for another posting. So we are. We will be coming to a yeah in July next year.

583
01:18:05.570 --&gt; 01:18:15.600
Martin: So from then she can start applying. So let&#39;s just keep that at the back of our mind. She really really has a prayer to

584
01:18:15.830 --&gt; 01:18:18.689
Martin: be able to move to to Nairobi.

585
01:18:19.240 --&gt; 01:18:25.519
Martin: where she she she really feels she&#39;s not been able, and I agree with her being able to be there with the girls

586
01:18:25.760 --&gt; 01:18:31.469
Martin: as much unengaged, mother. So let&#39;s put that request for

587
01:18:32.040 --&gt; 01:18:41.610
Martin: being closer for me. and when you&#39;re in Nairobi. You&#39;re in Kampala for all intents and purposes you&#39;re 45¬†min away. Yeah.

588
01:18:43.540 --&gt; 01:18:46.440
Martin: Kali, that&#39;s it from me.

589
01:18:46.600 --&gt; 01:18:48.570
Patrick Muinda: The hmm.

590
01:18:48.620 --&gt; 01:18:52.210
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. A a few us here last time. Yeah. So

591
01:18:53.570 --&gt; 01:19:05.510
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, as giving thanks for my summer. There&#39;s a very summer, the the last 2 months, 2 and a half months or so where II literally did nothing else.

592
01:19:05.780 --&gt; 01:19:11.420
Abimereki Muzaale: But it must myself in a while, which is 100% new to me using AI

593
01:19:12.090 --&gt; 01:19:19.529
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, so that that that is very exciting new tools. And

594
01:19:19.870 --&gt; 01:19:25.599
Abimereki Muzaale: I want to, I&#39;m I&#39;m going to be using them. I&#39;ve created a platform that allows me to collaborate

595
01:19:25.830 --&gt; 01:19:30.059
Abimereki Muzaale: more smoothly with students, colleagues.

596
01:19:30.260 --&gt; 01:19:31.450
Abimereki Muzaale: peers

597
01:19:31.720 --&gt; 01:19:36.790
Abimereki Muzaale: and you know, a anyone interacting with me in any capacity

598
01:19:36.870 --&gt; 01:19:39.090
Abimereki Muzaale: now goes through a system

599
01:19:39.840 --&gt; 01:19:46.789
Abimereki Muzaale: platform that it created. Yeah. So very excited about that, because it allows me to

600
01:19:46.980 --&gt; 01:19:49.220
Abimereki Muzaale: to to do much more

601
01:19:49.380 --&gt; 01:19:51.459
Abimereki Muzaale: than I would do as an individual

602
01:19:51.960 --&gt; 01:19:54.529
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;ll be able to do as an individual. So I&#39;m grateful.

603
01:19:55.570 --&gt; 01:19:59.710
Abimereki Muzaale: And you know, although they detain things as always.

604
01:19:59.870 --&gt; 01:20:04.490
Abimereki Muzaale: I I recently ordered new shoes.

605
01:20:04.590 --&gt; 01:20:13.340
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m an exercise, but at least I mean the process.

606
01:20:13.420 --&gt; 01:20:25.789
Martin: Oh, fixing this had you have these guys see those shoes? Sort of you see the shoes.

607
01:20:25.900 --&gt; 01:20:31.670
Martin: But but we need to mobilize money and and all the shoes.

608
01:20:31.710 --&gt; 01:20:39.050
Martin: Bokadiep, bring them! Trust me, you wear these trainers. Your knees will never feel a thing you just bounce on air.

609
01:20:39.060 --&gt; 01:20:45.070
sarahkayongo: Oh, you mean the

610
01:20:45.070 --&gt; 01:21:09.969
Abimereki Muzaale: the prices are down that come down the 300 in 2021 this time, which is 1 50. So that&#39;s a huge difference. Yeah, I&#39;m going to place an order the moment I can. And you please come with them. Oh, yeah, you just need to clarify, you know the virtual last time. I don&#39;t remember if the size was fine, I think the 11 and a half is all

611
01:21:09.970 --&gt; 01:21:10.530
okay.

612
01:21:10.720 --&gt; 01:21:12.550
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you confirm and say his advice.

613
01:21:12.900 --&gt; 01:21:20.550
Martin: But it was 11, and I think for me, I am 12. I just

614
01:21:20.650 --&gt; 01:21:22.569
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. 12 is safe for running

615
01:21:22.820 --&gt; 01:21:43.989
Abimereki Muzaale: women shoes.

616
01:21:55.670 --&gt; 01:22:02.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Uk.

617
01:22:03.170 --&gt; 01:22:11.400
sarahkayongo: are you guys different? What you mentioned sounds like mommy size, that kind of size.

618
01:22:11.920 --&gt; 01:22:33.200
Abimereki Muzaale: I know me. I think even Brenda will need.

619
01:22:33.220 --&gt; 01:23:03.179
Abimereki Muzaale: Yep. So you. You may not just come in with your rocks.

620
01:23:03.180 --&gt; 01:23:11.029
Abimereki Muzaale: So yeah. So I began hopefully, my final year, the Phd fourth year

621
01:23:11.280 --&gt; 01:23:18.000
Abimereki Muzaale: I only Phd. Requirements is the only thing sorry, not Phd requirements, only thesis

622
01:23:18.090 --&gt; 01:23:21.779
sarahkayongo: is what I&#39;m supposed to be focused on. DC.

623
01:23:22.260 --&gt; 01:23:51.389
Abimereki Muzaale:  I haven&#39;t done anything yet.

624
01:23:51.470 --&gt; 01:23:58.500
sarahkayongo: So it should be easy. But you know,

625
01:23:58.890 --&gt; 01:24:02.950
Abimereki Muzaale: I do not have all the data with me paid

626
01:24:03.040 --&gt; 01:24:18.849
Abimereki Muzaale: surface some data, and I just need to schedule time to access those data and all that stuff. But the main thing I&#39;ve been doing is my latest hire is laying down some automating set of processes for me that will make this a breeze

627
01:24:19.070 --&gt; 01:24:27.519
Abimereki Muzaale: laid down. I should move at very high speed. So let&#39;s pray that that happens sooner.

628
01:24:27.550 --&gt; 01:24:30.940
Abimereki Muzaale: and data, and then in the process of

629
01:24:31.600 --&gt; 01:24:39.379
Abimereki Muzaale: Pi think, prayed about it, but I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t write it down, but he prayed about it. My grants. Yeah.

630
01:24:39.400 --&gt; 01:24:43.199
Abimereki Muzaale: I need. I did. I need. I need grants. The more grants I have.

631
01:24:43.210 --&gt; 01:25:10.239
Abimereki Muzaale: The more jay I took about that percent. Yes, that applies everywhere, so I should call it protected time protected from seeing patients so protected from academic. The more money you have, the the more free. I do. Whatever is your beating

632
01:25:10.270 --&gt; 01:25:12.899
Abimereki Muzaale: so so grunt.

633
01:25:13.110 --&gt; 01:25:22.940
sarahkayongo: I wanted to submit October, but I&#39;ve not been able to. So next cycle is February.

634
01:25:22.970 --&gt; 01:25:27.029
Abimereki Muzaale: and so I pray that putting this together, that&#39;s a lot of work.

635
01:25:27.380 --&gt; 01:25:44.490
Martin: And and I just, I need to. I need to select collaborators and investigators. But, Kadi Khadi, you have because that means you have essentially October, November, and

636
01:25:44.710 --&gt; 01:25:55.349
Martin: that&#39;s pretty much it

637
01:25:55.640 --&gt; 01:26:06.500
Abimereki Muzaale: so II don&#39;t feel anything in my hip since the last.

638
01:26:06.550 --&gt; 01:26:20.520
Abimereki Muzaale: yes, symptom

639
01:26:21.730 --&gt; 01:26:29.660
Abimereki Muzaale: clearing my sinuses but II will consider seeing an ent session

640
01:26:30.530 --&gt; 01:26:34.000
Abimereki Muzaale: in the next month, or based on

641
01:26:34.200 --&gt; 01:26:41.730
Abimereki Muzaale: how I I&#39;ll be doing by then, but I feel much better. I can smell. I couldn&#39;t smell. I couldn&#39;t smell food.

642
01:26:41.920 --&gt; 01:26:43.820
Martin: I can see. Well.

643
01:26:43.880 --&gt; 01:26:46.329
Abimereki Muzaale: but now I can smell. I can smell the air

644
01:26:46.450 --&gt; 01:26:48.890
Abimereki Muzaale: and breathe better. So.

645
01:26:49.230 --&gt; 01:26:58.830
Abimereki Muzaale: This is the platform that is describing. So this this growth hasn&#39;t yet started because I haven&#39;t did expose people to it. I&#39;ve just been building it.

646
01:26:59.380 --&gt; 01:27:03.130
Abimereki Muzaale: But it&#39;s a platform through which people will be interacting with me.

647
01:27:03.470 --&gt; 01:27:08.350
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So so, yeah, so, so this is my press. So just give me one

648
01:27:08.420 --&gt; 01:27:11.020
Abimereki Muzaale: minute to

649
01:27:12.190 --&gt; 01:27:12.890
Abimereki Muzaale: oh.

650
01:27:13.090 --&gt; 01:27:16.520
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, I mean it just to

651
01:27:17.370 --&gt; 01:27:22.989
Abimereki Muzaale: transfer this cause. There&#39;s no freighting to transfer this year. I can copy and paste

652
01:27:24.020 --&gt; 01:27:25.700
Abimereki Muzaale: a few things here.

653
01:27:28.170 --&gt; 01:27:40.140
Martin: The Ministry of Education of Australia has formally introduced AI as a core tool that has to be used right from the get-go

654
01:27:40.220 --&gt; 01:27:43.669
Martin: in instruction. There was a lot of pushback from

655
01:27:43.820 --&gt; 01:27:56.900
Martin: parents and all that, but II just had the the, the press Conference of the Minister for Education, saying, no. You remember how we were against the calculator being handed to kids.

656
01:27:57.600 --&gt; 01:28:03.250
sarahkayongo: That&#39;s practical. Yes.

657
01:28:03.300 --&gt; 01:28:14.710
Abimereki Muzaale: most natural reaction across the world. AI has been in education wilders to to, to to ban it by gradually. Yeah.

658
01:28:14.840 --&gt; 01:28:28.999
Abimereki Muzaale: Evolving moving away from that. And for me. My, I got exposed to AI through a data science class. So II don&#39;t understand when people are regulations and risks cause for me. I&#39;ve been using it to develop apps.

659
01:28:29.150 --&gt; 01:28:41.880
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m like, what? So so when you&#39;re using Sunday for engineering, you roll your eyes at other people&#39;s consignments.

660
01:28:42.350 --&gt; 01:28:43.400
Abimereki Muzaale: A

661
01:28:43.820 --&gt; 01:28:45.090
actually

662
01:28:45.660 --&gt; 01:28:48.009
Martin: that thing data sciences.

663
01:28:48.330 --&gt; 01:28:58.890
Patrick Muinda: I know. Patty got Chat Gbt. To write Martin a letter convincing him to pursue a career in data science brilliant.

664
01:28:59.650 --&gt; 01:29:07.329
Martin: He just spoke audio audio. To the mic is delivered that audio very

665
01:29:07.370 --&gt; 01:29:16.569
Martin: converted, but it was a brilliant, brilliant analysis, and us like, now look at this. This is not even funny.

666
01:29:16.900 --&gt; 01:29:31.429
sarahkayongo: No, I don&#39;t.

667
01:29:31.670 --&gt; 01:29:34.619
Martin: I do for a while. My post, yeah.

668
01:29:35.380 --&gt; 01:29:42.609
sarahkayongo: And then when she saw it, she&#39;s like fantastic. This is good. In fact, your let&#39;s put you on the Ukraine.

669
01:29:42.840 --&gt; 01:29:45.139
sarahkayongo: Well, the Ukraine project.

670
01:29:45.930 --&gt; 01:29:55.980
sarahkayongo: It was more of a speculation.

671
01:29:56.330 --&gt; 01:30:00.119
Patrick Muinda: One thing I see

672
01:30:00.520 --&gt; 01:30:03.640
Patrick Muinda: is that you need to know how to ask the right question.

673
01:30:03.690 --&gt; 01:30:07.180
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Oh, the media to ask the right question. Detail.

674
01:30:07.350 --&gt; 01:30:09.590
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yes. Yes.

675
01:30:09.860 --&gt; 01:30:17.520
Patrick Muinda: Well, once once you&#39;re able to ask the right thing in the right intensity and detail. I tell you it will work for you.

676
01:30:17.590 --&gt; 01:30:21.780
Patrick Muinda: but someone who doesn&#39;t know how to do that will find it a very boring tool.

677
01:30:22.320 --&gt; 01:30:32.540
sarahkayongo: Now, in in research, even, you&#39;re talking now like a research at the right research question. Everything.

678
01:30:33.250 --&gt; 01:30:34.160
sarahkayongo: Yeah.

679
01:30:34.270 --&gt; 01:30:35.720
Martin: very, very true.

680
01:30:35.750 --&gt; 01:30:37.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Alright. So

681
01:30:37.650 --&gt; 01:30:42.590
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I&#39;ve finished posting here. It&#39;s it&#39;s going to take about 30¬†s to load.

682
01:30:42.840 --&gt; 01:30:47.470
Patrick Muinda: I wanted to understand from you

683
01:30:47.650 --&gt; 01:31:01.139
Patrick Muinda: why is ending the Phd. Tougher than starting it, cause II want to finish. But everything seems to be there. There&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t have.

684
01:31:01.300 --&gt; 01:31:09.680
Martin: I&#39;m trying to finish, and since slowing down like landing on aircraft is just. Yeah. Landing is harder than take off.

685
01:31:10.250 --&gt; 01:31:18.730
sarahkayongo: anyway. Now you have to assemble all these things, and you you&#39;ll even have to forget where you started.

686
01:31:18.740 --&gt; 01:31:28.460
sarahkayongo: We? Okay? Oh, yeah, that has changed a lot has changed exactly. It seems like you did it long time ago.

687
01:31:28.760 --&gt; 01:31:36.729
sarahkayongo: And then here volume of data you have to go through to now. Begin writing.

688
01:31:38.150 --&gt; 01:31:44.910
sarahkayongo: III don&#39;t remember. Sorry you know what I&#39;ve completed writing.

689
01:31:45.060 --&gt; 01:31:49.549
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;ve finished writing. But now putting it all together.

690
01:31:49.570 --&gt; 01:31:56.460
sarahkayongo: No, no, putting it together in the form that is a real, that is a synthesis. Now

691
01:31:56.720 --&gt; 01:32:02.059
Martin: you have data points, information of the writing which sections

692
01:32:03.070 --&gt; 01:32:14.200
Patrick Muinda: I have finished my my chapter. One introduction through Literature Review. I&#39;ve done methodology. I&#39;ve written my findings. I&#39;m now in discussion of findings.

693
01:32:15.680 --&gt; 01:32:19.179
sarahkayongo: You. Okay, yeah, wait. Wait.

694
01:32:19.600 --&gt; 01:32:30.200
Martin: You did your data analysis already. Yes, I&#39;m done. And the results are so exciting. I&#39;m going to share with you.

695
01:32:43.420 --&gt; 01:32:47.109
sarahkayongo: I&#39;m through like a a

696
01:32:47.930 --&gt; 01:32:50.070
Patrick Muinda: Hi, I&#39;m good enough.

697
01:32:50.630 --&gt; 01:33:17.409
sarahkayongo: I&#39;m I&#39;m through the data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, using thematic analysis for the qualitative. I use the structure equation.

698
01:33:18.400 --&gt; 01:33:21.039
sarahkayongo: III don&#39;t even.
