<h3>Session 6.3<a class="headerlink" href="#session-6-3" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Dear East African Family,</p>
<p>On Friday, February 3rd, I had a scan – a PET MRI Dotatate whole body scan to see if I have a resurgence of my cancer. I got the results last week and I’m still trying to digest them, because they are mixed – some new tumors growing in my bones and lymph nodes, but still a good result with the old tumors smaller and inactive. I still haven’t heard from the doctor about what the next steps should be. I’ll try to explain this type of special scan – don’t hesitate to ask questions.</p>
<p>The Dotatate is a radioisotope scan that attaches specifically to tumor cells and to neuroendocrine organs like the pituitary, adrenal glands and pancreas - basically a whole body geiger counter that shows tumor activity. The PET MRI gives a better picture of tissues to show tumor size and shape.</p>
<p>In the last 12 plus years I’ve had nearly 50 scans and each one comes with uncertain expectations and often mixed results. Two, however, have stood out in their clarity: in 2020 when the results were “too numerous to count new metastases in liver and bone” it resulted in the start of PRRT, the intravenous radiation that attaches to tumors with a radiation dose 50 times greater than that of the scan, and in 2022 with the “Amazing response to PRRT - no tumor functional activity”.</p>
<p>The results from Friday just came out today, and I also received a copy of Dr. Bergsland’s notes, 11 pages long, outlining that 12 year history and her recommendations. First, I have several small new tumors, in a lymph node, rib and pelvis. Dr. Bergsland characterized this as “slight progressive disease” 2 years after the very successful PRRT. I still have the fracture of my sacrum which has caused me to retire my downhill skis and limits how far I can hike and what I can safely carry. I also continue to have episodes of cholangitis and fever from bacteria going upstream into the liver’s biliary system, including one yesterday with a several hour fever up to 102.6F.  I may need additional radiation for the active bony tumors or restart the monthly targeted chemotherapy injections that were stopped last August. But overall, this is a very good report and I am glad to be doing this well after 12 years living with pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you for your encouragement, calls, thoughts and prayers on this cancer journey. An editorial in 1986 in the New England Journal of Medicine by a pediatrician and double cancer survivor described living with cancer as accepting and embracing uncertainty. Twenty five years later I hosted a dinner for a visiting team supporting the University of Zambia Medical School, described my cancer and mentioned that editorial, without knowing that the author was standing in front of me! So while there is uncertainty in this report, I am ever grateful for the high tech diagnostic and treatment options that have kept me alive and (relatively) well.</p>
<p>We are planning to come to Kenya in August and September and hope to see many of you in Kilifi. Our time there will be complicated so I can’t yet give firm dates, but probably the last two weeks in August or early September will be best. Our partner Buck is coming sometime in September, but we don’t yet know how long. We are also having several couples from California coming at different times. We will let you know but hope we can see you in 2023.</p>
<p>Love,
Larry</p>

<Details>
  <Summary>Transcript by Zoom's AI</Summary>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Here&#39;s the cleaned up version of your transcript with speakers assigned to their respective initials:
S (Sarah Kayongo): Things.
S: Yeah.
P (Patrick Muinda): Yeah.
P: Okay, let me try to find the notes. I don&#39;t know where I put them, I think. D (Abimereki Muzaale): Did they share the notes? Yeah.
S: Yes, we can see it.
D: So who is going? Trust? No, no, no, you&#39;ve not. I shared the notes, but I have no idea where I saved them. I mean, just give me a second. Can you find them?
P: Okay, I&#39;ll be going in the meantime. Explaining.
P: I am completely well, Dorothy is okay. That should do enough framing.
P: Work is a bit relaxed because the financial year ended.
P: So there is now completely no money, so there is no government activity.
P: I think the money will come when finance releases this, it will be very interesting.
P: So we&#39;re waiting for them to release it. As I said, there&#39;s a fine line between tragedy and comedy.
J (Martin Muwaga): But what you&#39;ve not mentioned is that the government now, from the beginning of this financial year, they just announced domestic borrowing.
J: They have said. They are chilling.
J: The trade, they&#39;re easing off on the Treasury bonds and all that. So that&#39;s why the value has really gone up because they&#39;re like we need to manage.
P: I would agree. But they&#39;re waking up really late because we have where we... D: We&#39;re drowning in debt. I think I found some notes which I&#39;m testing here.
J: But...
D: Yeah, I just...
D: I just...
D: 2023. Yes, that&#39;s... 
D: Because it&#39;s...
P: Thank you. Yeah. So we? I am now spending more time concentrating on trying to finish. Chapter 4, I submitted, and then I got changes to make. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m working on right now.
P: It is a lot right? Writing actually is very, very intensive. Time, energy and brain intensive. After about 2 or 3 hours, you feel like you&#39;ve been running a marathon.
P: Yeah. So you&#39;re putting things together from so many places. So...
P: It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m making progress. I am hoping that I should be done this week, this coming week with Chapter 4. And I said, discussing the findings that he says he wants to...
P: To contribute to the discussion because he has been following what has been going on. The entire research. So he says, given your results, I want to also contribute and give ideas.
P: What he thinks. So I&#39;m happy about that. At the office.
P: As I said, things are largely going down.
P: And we are in that place where we are believing good for new things.
P: Dorothy also is okay. You know they did that restructuring got a promotion. However, the promotion means going to a different body.
P: And then they also, the letter she received says that she retains the terms and conditions. So we wondered what type of promotion that was.
P: So we are seeking clarification, seeking clarification next week for them to tell us what they mean. Exactly.
P: How do you get a promotion? Then your terms and conditions of service remain the same. I think it was standard language for those who have been demoted. I think it was a standard language for everyone.
J: Yeah, it&#39;s those who are going down are being, but not upwards. Yeah. So how do you send the standard language to all? And yet that is a very incompetent HR office. So wherever they are, they are exceedingly incompetent and don&#39;t understand what they are doing.

 P: So that was surprising and borderline upsetting.
P: So we hope that we shall get a good clarification, a verbal clarification, in the course of this coming week.
P: Because we&#39;d rather stay in Kampala if the terms and conditions are the same. We would rather retain the position and then go, you know?
P: So that is the thing. Then when you...
P: Yeah, it&#39;s a prayer. It&#39;s a very important request, one to pray for Dorothy that this is going to be sorted out, and that she even stays in Kampala. There is no real reason why she should go up country.
P: She served up country so many times for many years. There are so many young people...
P: Who should be given that opportunity to go and work up country.
P: So we hope for me. I&#39;m doing good for promotion. I think promotions are not happening in the government...
P: For some time. I&#39;ve not been hearing them happen.
P: But you know God doesn&#39;t wait for things to happen for everyone, only before he blesses you. So I trust that one thing it will happen. I&#39;ve been in this
__
S (Sarah Kayongo): So, who spreads her rumors? Can you be part of the rumor machine?
P (Patrick Muinda): Now, I was blacklisted among those who contributed to her removal. So they put me on a hit list. I am among those supposed to really pay for removing her best friend.
P: Her best friend, the most confident one, the one she praises every meeting. She&#39;s praising him and this is a single lady. We could misunderstand everything because their closeness was just too much. If we are not actually understanding, we could seriously misunderstand everything.
P: That is what has been going on. The new person is very objective and he doesn&#39;t operate like we did at all. There&#39;s a lady who has been brought in to be the Under Secretary, but we suspect she was brought in to take over.
S: That&#39;s great for that to happen. I&#39;m reading the Book of Fox and Second Kings. And you think the world is messed up right now. Oh, my God! These Kings! There were too many bloody coups.
S: Yes, it was the game of thrones way before. So, let us pray that this happens. Yes, we got confirmed in office, and because she&#39;s acting now, the other one is on leave. We have such peace in the office, work is flowing, people are well motivated, and everyone really wants to support her, to succeed.
P: The difficult post is temporary. You know their contracts end soon.
S: Oh, okay, their contracts end next month. So of course, we are praying that she should be posted elsewhere. Whatever the board chooses to do, we just pray that the one who is acting now stays. That&#39;s what we prefer.
P: Yeah, so that&#39;s how it is at the office. Work is ongoing. I&#39;ve been at that job for so long. I need a new experience. But before that, I need to finish my studies. I don&#39;t want a new responsibility that demands so much from me.
S: So that I can make any progress.
P: By the end of this year, I should have made significant progress. By Christmas time, I should really be looking at other things, summarizing publications and the like. The main thesis should be done by the end of this year.
P: My children are doing well. Nicole is okay. She hurt her foot kicking a stone, but she&#39;s being taken good care of. Lisa is fine. She wants to become a head girl. She had a meeting to understand why she didn&#39;t go through in P5. And now, she&#39;s focusing on strengthening those areas so that she&#39;s better prepared in P6 for the head girl test.
P: Yes, it will happen. She is very determined. Yesterday, we celebrated Dorothy&#39;s sister&#39;s 40th birthday. It was a very happy occasion. She&#39;s in Uganda. Deborah, the youngest, arrived a few weeks ago.
D (Abimereki Muzaale): No, no, she&#39;s in summer school.
P: Okay, we&#39;re praying for her. That is a real prayer request, because when I see doctors doing something and it doesn&#39;t seem to work, then they claim they have found it and nothing changes. It disturbs everyone. They have paid so much money for surgery and whatever, and there&#39;s no change.
P: She&#39;s also doing a Ph.D., so you can imagine having the stress of health issues and also having to deal with her studies. It&#39;s not good at all. Tomorrow, we celebrate Dorothy&#39;s mother&#39;s birthday. She&#39;s now 77. I think she&#39;s younger than our mom, who is 78.
S: No, she&#39;s 75. Take 10 away from 85.
P: Okay. We&#39;re going to celebrate her birthday. You remember, she almost died last

 year, just when Covid was winding up. S: So I&#39;m confident.
P: It wasn&#39;t Covid. It&#39;s one of the most common diseases in the lungs. But she didn&#39;t have just one clot, she had many.
S: Wow.
P: Every doctor who saw her knew that she could go anytime. But God preserved her life until all those clots dissolved and she&#39;s completely healed. She&#39;s very strong. You won&#39;t believe it. At the dinner table, you can&#39;t believe she&#39;s the same one who was in the hospital. God has been so faithful.
P: The kids are fine. They&#39;re very well taken care of and very strong. We thank God for that. That&#39;s how I&#39;ve been. Nothing very out of the ordinary. That&#39;s me.
__
D (Abimereki Muzaale): It&#39;s very humbling, you know. The competition is not even close to Zoom. The difference is just unbelievable. So, I&#39;m really good. The issue is there is a higher demand. This is a student that I worked with during the lockdown. You, as in the person at the time was an undergraduate. Now, they&#39;re a medical student.
D: And they&#39;re from Maryland, so it&#39;s around with the US, where they could work with me again, and it&#39;s like sure. We will finish up stuff and get it all published.
D: The student is brilliant. Unbelievably brilliant, for this level of training. So I&#39;m very excited to have this, two very outstanding individuals doing great work.
D: So, the hiring process is ongoing. And the numbers may seem large to you guys, but the others have got it right. The Chinese guy contributed to the workflow that I&#39;m trying to set up in AI.
D: This productivity is going to be like 300 people, it&#39;s going to be huge.
D: I&#39;m starting a crazy and ambitious journey, but wow, we&#39;re leveraging what our people from data science and AI can do. So, hopefully, things will be set up.
D: Yes, you can expect a lot of growth.
D: I&#39;m scheduled to travel for conferences. This morning, I traveled safely to San Diego, and even went over shorts and made it to Mexico. Did you go by train? How did you?
D: Yeah, and I&#39;m extremely grateful for the swimming skills. I&#39;ve been absent from it since then, and I really need to get back to it.

D: So, that&#39;s about it for now. I did make the request to be able to formulate the most efficient plan for my team, because I believe there&#39;s a lot we can achieve in a short time.
D: I need to submit grants by October. Some grants, I want to be able to submit two to three, and the quality of the submission and the teams for the team collaborators should be part of the call.
D: One thing I&#39;ve learned over the last 17 years since I first came to the US is that I need to improve my collaboration skills. Maybe because I was mostly in school and the academic setup in school at the time was individualistic.
D: Yeah, no collaboration. But in the real world, everything is about collaboration. I struggle with it, I&#39;m an assertive personality.
D: I can be very irritable. I get very irritated if I feel people just don&#39;t get the point. People have spoken behind my back, which I&#39;ve heard through other sources. People I&#39;ve never worked with describe me in certain ways, and that&#39;s a problem, not how I&#39;m described, but the fact that it&#39;s a fact.
P: Yeah.
D: I think you have two things going on, your phone and something else. But anyway, let me just wrap up.
S (Sarah Kayongo): Got it. But you know, the way to deal with that is, everyone knows that you&#39;re going back to redo everything because no one will be at your level, especially if you&#39;re the lead.
D: Well, you can&#39;t be the lead in everything, you know. S: Just go along.
D: Sure, I think I&#39;m now more conscious of it. The first complaints I really had because of my friends way back, but I know about the issue now.
J (Martin Muwaga): I had to, but you know I ignored them. So, I&#39;m not too sure what you mean by &quot;going along&quot;. We&#39;re on this journey of self-discovery, and we recognize certain flaws. But then there is a way it can be done. When you&#39;re dismissive, you just learn to use certain terms which are agreeable.
S: To achieve things beyond individual human potential, my whole work is actually to collaborate across practice areas and with the government. You just sit there and listen to everyone, and you&#39;re agreeable. And then, you figure out what is useful and what is not. That&#39;s the essence of collaboration. You start from the broad perspective where you just listen. As you go higher, the circle becomes smaller and you can become assertive. But you can&#39;t be very assertive at the bottom.

 D: Yeah, well, I&#39;m grateful that I have a better understanding of that aspect of me now. And you know, I think I got the best understanding after reading the responses, the reviews by students. I think those clarified everything. Because then that was a huge, dealing with hundreds of actual anonymous descriptions...

__

Certainly! Here is the edited dialogue:

S: You first get their feedback. Ask them questions, then continue and be ready to change courses.
J: I don&#39;t even know how one can teach that. Anyway, back to this thing. To me, I think your support is something I don&#39;t know. We have to move to the rest, but what you say is just so profound. So if you could give it just a few extra moments. Do you think, with these insights that you have,
D: Is there a way you could actively show that you&#39;re working on this feedback? And people are aware that they can say that, something different we are saying because it&#39;s one thing you having it and you just internalizing it. But then your contemporaries cannot necessarily see those actions.
J: Do you see what I&#39;m trying to say? I see a fight. Yes, that&#39;s a good thing. I&#39;m gonna do something that I&#39;ve never done before in my life.
D: I&#39;m going out to. I don&#39;t call my friends. I don&#39;t call you guys. I usually receive calls. You can attest to that. I never call. But when someone calls, yeah, that&#39;s with family. I think a few days ago someone said, you need to start calling. That&#39;s it, everyone calls me. I never call.
D: Same with my friends. So one thing I&#39;m going to try to do differently, and I&#39;m not going to try, I&#39;m just going to do, is to reach out more. Wow! Oh, this is my journal, right? So I don&#39;t know. Yeah.
D: So what I&#39;m trying to say is I&#39;ll be going out, equivalent to making calls, to check on you guys, update you, and catch up. I need to do that with my colleagues.
D: That&#39;s with the Department of Surgery. The head of some of the bosses wanted to reach out to me just wanted to meet me to chat about something, so that&#39;s too busy.
D: I guess they call me spontaneously. Yeah. And I was like, my schedule is full, but I need to actively go to see them out and say, just wanted to meet and discuss.
D: I&#39;ll go with an open mind. So that&#39;s number one for the higher-ups. Then my colleagues, I&#39;m going to start communicating more frequently just to check on them. Ask them how I could be helpful. This is something my mentor said, You know.
D: Yeah, just ask people how you could be helpful. Well, for my students, that one I&#39;ve already started working on. And this concept is what&#39;s guiding me.

D: You know, considering the challenge levels that I present to them. Because if I give it, if I&#39;m aggressive, I&#39;m creating a very hostile environment. High challenge levels. I think of me. And if you don&#39;t have the skills for that, your low skill for that, you&#39;ve been the zone, you know, high challenge environment, you&#39;ll be anxious to some other thing.

P: But how do these kids make it into Hopkins? Yet they had such crazy GPAs. Can they deal with pressure?

D: Very good question. I&#39;m with students from all of America&#39;s top universities, and you&#39;ll be amazed that they come. Even in those great places, there&#39;s a distribution. There&#39;s a mean and a standard deviation and so, I don&#39;t see anything extraordinary. I mentioned this to you. I&#39;ve been at Johns Hopkins for 17 years, and there&#39;s nothing extraordinary about the people here.

D: And I always ask what makes an institution outstanding. They&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s money in America. For those interested in European football, there is a team called Liverpool. They did something extraordinary in 2005 at the Champions League level that they did again about 5 years ago.

D: Now the footballers were not the same, but the money was. It&#39;s the same organization. But there&#39;s something indescribable in their DNA. Most people are not extraordinary. There&#39;s just a few. My mentor is one of the few extraordinary people I&#39;ve met. Definitely, absolutely outstanding.

D: Students that I have, are some of the smartest I&#39;ve ever met.

S: These abilities, but that extraordinaryness can only be amplified through the collaboration because of those people skills. Your boss comes to town, and they&#39;re like, &quot;Who has been in the office on Monday?&quot; And yet we&#39;re not supposed to be in the office.

S: Everyone was volunteering. It&#39;s politics. Everyone, because there is something to be gained by having proximity to your student at all these levels. Actually, I like how you&#39;ve done it to everyone.

S: Especially the upper echelon, because you learn so much about how they engage their students. You learn from them.
D: You have to go out and drink with the students sometimes, and that one is out of the question. Many of the trainees are girls and hanging out in certain crowds can be too dangerous. That&#39;s a skill I really need to work on.

D: You know.

S: I&#39;m involved in partnerships, skepticism, and senior advice. It&#39;s going to be based in DC, which helped me. I received an email on my way back from Paris about a job that was moved and updated. They added the aspect of innovation and mentioned I had interviewed for it. Apparently, I was one of the top candidates, and they wanted to interview me again. I asked for a week to prepare, and I was able to do so. My dissertation on building partnerships and developing innovative financial models was useful. I had a Skype interview with the resident for East Africa. That day, I spoke with mom, and Kevin and Lauren prayed for me. I was somewhat overwhelmed but faced the interview confidently. I&#39;ve had many job interviews in Nairobi before, and I noticed that the dynamics change when there&#39;s a Kenyan on the panel. This time, however, there was no Kenyan, only very high-level individuals. Despite the challenging interview, I received an email the next day asking for references. They wanted two former supervisors and one professional network contact. I provided them, and now my references are being checked. I&#39;m praying because I want this job.

J: Those jobs may not seem glamorous on a day-to-day basis, but the UN offers benefits and security. In Uganda, every middle-class or wealthy individual is just one health emergency away from financial ruin. I&#39;ve prayed for a job at the UN that will take care of me as I age. I&#39;m a single mom now. They raised the retirement age to 67. That is a significant change. I don&#39;t care who the other candidate is, I want to be there. Expressing gratitude is essential. Going to Freetown was a challenge. It&#39;s a long journey, and the city isn&#39;t as inviting as one might expect. It was difficult, but my mission was simple: help Brenda settle down, identify an apartment, and get a doctor who can move her around because she needs help with multitasking. We found a nice apartment on top of the town, and for that, we are grateful. Let&#39;s keep praying. My father-in-law is unwell. He collapsed during a walk around Mutungo due to a clot. He had to be rushed to the hospital.

D: This sounds serious. He underwent surgery in 2017. However, I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s been taking any prescribed medicine since then.

P: But he was. I don&#39;t recall it being Jay. My M is at a disadvantage, isn&#39;t she? She told me what was going on, and she was very clear. She was saying that this man is getting him into too much trouble, and I think you may want to reconsider.

J: Exactly. But, mommy, my dad is not going to say it&#39;s mommy. He knows exactly where it came from. He knows where the command came from, but I think that he told Kudi, even at some point that I suspect that Jenny is coordinating behind. Oh, yes, yes, they told us way back, mommy told me and said, I don&#39;t want you to.

S: I think. May I bring attention to it before all of you guys?

D: He said, what amazes me is the consistency of your personality from challenge? You&#39;re not excited by much. Anyone who approaches you with excitement is likely to end up disappointed and frustrated. A straightforward observer. This is the most consistent. Call me. I&#39;m different from my friends, the girls, the boys can never say that I&#39;m not a hundred percent consistent. But I wouldn&#39;t say that. How come I have the best conversations with you? Well, I mean, that&#39;s interesting. Because interactions are, you know, unique. How unique? Yeah. So the but that one I would I, Christopher, saying, you know, you are completely emotionless. Yeah, the only people you know, people whose emotion you care about are Bach and Beethoven. And

S: Yeah, yeah, I think. But do any of those girls come to you also discussing BA. And philosophy and trying to learn from me? No one studies classical music, you know. No, no, okay, any philosophy, anything, one that honestly, there are people who, if they don&#39;t stimulate that part of your brain. Oh, yeah, it&#39;s just that you mentioned. Because and I have In a way, I&#39;m not okay. I&#39;ll admit that we, we should. We share a lot in common, by the way, and you&#39;re the only person you&#39;re the only person who recommends a movie to me or a TV show. I know you&#39;re the only person like and anyone else will be suggesting something I don&#39;t shake my head so like, so that that my point is when it comes to letting go. You know relations. Then, if I talk to a man and he&#39;s and that&#39;s why I think Derek was very. You know he could become anything, you know. and he said Genius in that he can sound like a very smart person. Yeah, I I I would not be interested or in a conversation with the man on the opposite side. Naturally. intelligent, you know, they someone has to stimulate my, my, my brain, not just my brain first. Oh, this guy I I just told you in the beginning. I had to look at this speak, and then he was some so kind of like, Wow, he&#39;s smart. Then we can have a conversation. I guys.

P: That is true. Yeah.

D: Well, that is true. Today I&#39;ve been documenting your progress. And so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re done. We we we we are done, and so we will have to wrap up in about

J: I can stop recording, and then.

Patrick: It did.

2
00:00:01.670 --&gt; 00:00:06.119
sarahkayongo: It says, how

3
00:00:06.140 --&gt; 00:00:18.370
sarahkayongo: how urgent it was. You know how urgently they needed feedback. And you know they&#39;re like, Oh, yeah, take your time, I mean, just make sure you submit. Give us the feedback

4
00:00:18.730 --&gt; 00:00:26.239
sarahkayongo: before, so we can understand the changes.

5
00:00:26.380 --&gt; 00:00:28.349
sarahkayongo: So that put me at ease.

6
00:00:28.690 --&gt; 00:00:33.269
sarahkayongo: and I was able to, because your other work continues.

7
00:00:33.450 --&gt; 00:00:37.820
sarahkayongo: But then you have to go back and correct all these.

8
00:00:38.500 --&gt; 00:00:51.259
sarahkayongo: And then actually, once you put your mind to to making the corrections, you&#39;d be surprised to realize they are not when professors are speaking back at you or giving you feedback

9
00:00:51.820 --&gt; 00:01:07.530
sarahkayongo: this thinking big terms, and it may feel like you have to almost change entire. But but then, when I realized, okay, they were actually minimal. And that&#39;s the same thing. I&#39;ve experienced in publishing.

10
00:01:07.960 --&gt; 00:01:22.760
sarahkayongo: Right? You think that is bad. You try publishing a paper, and you submit it to a journal. They come up with all sorts of, and you almost entirely have to change. I remember we&#39;ve had.

11
00:01:23.370 --&gt; 00:01:25.400
sarahkayongo: you know, the last paper with

12
00:01:25.650 --&gt; 00:01:26.490
sarahkayongo: the

13
00:01:26.690 --&gt; 00:01:27.870
sarahkayongo: We publish.

14
00:01:28.180 --&gt; 00:01:33.289
Patrick: It took us a long time, because every journal we realized, okay, we need to stop

15
00:01:33.510 --&gt; 00:01:40.839
sarahkayongo: because we almost change the type. Not only that type we reached up point or like.

16
00:01:40.920 --&gt; 00:01:42.400
sarahkayongo: This is no longer.

17
00:01:42.490 --&gt; 00:01:50.880
sarahkayongo: You read paper every every, every editor, every reviewer is giving us all sorts of feedback.

18
00:01:51.440 --&gt; 00:01:52.710
Patrick: so

19
00:01:53.120 --&gt; 00:01:58.040
sarahkayongo: don&#39;t get so that is called pijon hauling yourself

20
00:01:58.830 --&gt; 00:02:01.879
sarahkayongo: so don&#39;t get pigeon told

21
00:02:02.780 --&gt; 00:02:08.490
sarahkayongo: and I think a week is good enough. It&#39;s sufficient. There&#39;s nothing wrong.

22
00:02:09.210 --&gt; 00:02:14.659
sarahkayongo: Okay? So another thing is, maybe give it another week. If you have to

23
00:02:14.740 --&gt; 00:02:23.350
sarahkayongo: understand the deadline for submitting the changes a a negotiate, for you know an extension, if need be.

24
00:02:23.890 --&gt; 00:02:31.489
sarahkayongo: and give it a fresh new set of ads. But the question is motivation.

25
00:02:31.800 --&gt; 00:02:37.710
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, motivation is the origin of everything. You can&#39;t start something until

26
00:02:37.780 --&gt; 00:02:46.839
Abimereki Muzaale: you have the motivation. Otherwise it will just be a thought. But so the question is motivation. How do you get to action?

27
00:02:47.440 --&gt; 00:02:50.420
Abimereki Muzaale: And that&#39;s that. That is original question.

28
00:02:50.590 --&gt; 00:03:03.410
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, what you&#39;re giving is advice, but advice does not affect motivation motivation from from within.

29
00:03:03.470 --&gt; 00:03:13.650
sarahkayongo: Motivation is from within, not from without, within. Yes, yes, yes, so you cannot advise. That&#39;s an external that&#39;s external influence you can&#39;t advise right now. You you feel what you

30
00:03:13.760 --&gt; 00:03:23.590
sarahkayongo: experiencing is burnout. Give me time. That&#39;s African.

31
00:03:23.640 --&gt; 00:03:27.089
Abimereki Muzaale: A European will take coffee

32
00:03:27.160 --&gt; 00:03:28.930
Patrick: and will roll

33
00:03:45.790 --&gt; 00:04:02.939
Abimereki Muzaale: I Europeans, and is like this before drinking coffee all day. Not for fun. No one finds coffee delicious. It&#39;s bitter by definition, yeah, drink espresso. First of all, sure that they&#39;re not interested in the taste, the quantity.

34
00:04:02.970 --&gt; 00:04:08.750
Patrick: It&#39;s so tiny. The cups are microscopic. They&#39;re like so tiny. But then dots

35
00:04:08.920 --&gt; 00:04:25.370
Abimereki Muzaale: Americans cannot handle that call. It&#39;s too bitter. So Americans add a lot of water. But America and milk and sugar have a tiny, very tiny cookie with it, because very bitter. So then a drink? No, he&#39;s having coffee for fun

36
00:04:25.550 --&gt; 00:04:47.779
Abimereki Muzaale: you know. It&#39;s not delicious. It&#39;s not delicious. Let me pull up slides. Of course, what I&#39;m pulling up touching you&#39;ll be already familiar with.

37
00:04:47.950 --&gt; 00:04:52.139
Abimereki Muzaale: but I would pull it up, anyway.

38
00:04:52.390 --&gt; 00:04:55.320
Abimereki Muzaale: How to find it!

39
00:04:55.600 --&gt; 00:05:00.560
Patrick: II will certainly try that out. I think I should also add some little milk to it.

40
00:05:00.850 --&gt; 00:05:05.150
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s

41
00:05:06.610 --&gt; 00:05:27.969
Abimereki Muzaale: blood pressure at all in all of this. Yeah, we talked about.

42
00:05:28.290 --&gt; 00:05:39.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, right now, actually, III right now, I&#39;m not healthy physically. Yeah. And and is that good? Is that? But that&#39;s a different question.

43
00:05:39.390 --&gt; 00:05:44.939
Abimereki Muzaale: But I know I&#39;ve not done a good job. Health, wise physically.

44
00:05:45.200 --&gt; 00:05:54.800
Abimereki Muzaale: But this is this has come. This graph has come from one of my students. So I have about 300 students I&#39;ve taught in the last 2 years.

45
00:05:54.820 --&gt; 00:06:01.059
Abimereki Muzaale: I noticed in the reviews until until was it may I can&#39;t remember May, June.

46
00:06:01.120 --&gt; 00:06:11.279
Abimereki Muzaale: and the way, more negative than I expected, which is very shocking. I was very surprised. No, my

47
00:06:11.370 --&gt; 00:06:13.880
Abimereki Muzaale: classes that I&#39;m teaching were very negative

48
00:06:14.150 --&gt; 00:06:22.909
Abimereki Muzaale: notice. Students are not very impressed

49
00:06:23.060 --&gt; 00:06:41.259
Abimereki Muzaale: but one student made a comment and said, I need to get remedial classes in educational learning theory. Oh, I need to do that. Did you ever take those at all? I did not do any classes, but I just give III remember that comment stuck

50
00:06:41.270 --&gt; 00:06:54.229
Abimereki Muzaale: the comments stuck. I was looking for remedial classes or anything. But I run into this graph.

51
00:06:54.900 --&gt; 00:06:55.770
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

52
00:06:55.870 --&gt; 00:07:08.390
Abimereki Muzaale: I run into this graph. I know I give you the code for the scrub, but I updated it now so I can give you the quote again. And you can reproduce this using Google or the Google call up, Yeah.

53
00:07:08.560 --&gt; 00:07:18.820
Abimereki Muzaale: so this graph for me is as turned out to be so powerful. It describes everything. Yeah.

54
00:07:18.950 --&gt; 00:07:24.259
Abimereki Muzaale: that in life this is not only for students. Or you can think of all of us as students of life.

55
00:07:24.840 --&gt; 00:07:25.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

56
00:07:25.880 --&gt; 00:07:39.660
Abimereki Muzaale: then in life, you&#39;re gonna find challenges and the the level that we should find them quantified. Yeah, just let&#39;s just say so this is a skill of 0 to 10. And this and your skill level is 0 to 10.

57
00:07:40.290 --&gt; 00:07:51.359
Abimereki Muzaale: As you can imagine, everyone probably has experience situation where you have a challenge exceeding your skills. emotional state, you&#39;re emotional state.

58
00:07:51.610 --&gt; 00:07:56.090
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s not gonna be bored. It&#39;s gonna be closer to anxious. Yeah.

59
00:07:57.040 --&gt; 00:08:07.279
Abimereki Muzaale: In charge. That exceeds your your skills where you cannot see how you&#39;re gonna solve this, especially if it&#39;s a challenge that&#39;s relevant that you can just walk away from

60
00:08:07.460 --&gt; 00:08:11.619
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah your your emotions are, gonna be in this zone.

61
00:08:11.840 --&gt; 00:08:23.150
Abimereki Muzaale: and or if your skills are exceeding like 6 exceeding a challenge of 2, yeah. you&#39;re more likely to be bored

62
00:08:23.260 --&gt; 00:08:25.640
Abimereki Muzaale: or relaxed. Yeah.

63
00:08:25.850 --&gt; 00:08:27.580
Patrick: Body. But when

64
00:08:27.950 --&gt; 00:08:33.830
Abimereki Muzaale: when your challenge is high, let&#39;s say here, close to 3,

65
00:08:34.270 --&gt; 00:08:41.900
Abimereki Muzaale: and your your skill is like just 1.5, and you step up your game. You step it up.

66
00:08:42.270 --&gt; 00:08:49.650
Abimereki Muzaale: And yeah, you&#39;re in the board of Re, the red zone and stupid. I&#39;ve been up in this yellow game. That&#39;s a zone of engagement.

67
00:08:49.990 --&gt; 00:08:54.499
Abimereki Muzaale: Your mind is so absorbed and then you experience victory

68
00:08:54.660 --&gt; 00:08:56.539
Abimereki Muzaale: as you go away from

69
00:08:56.600 --&gt; 00:09:04.449
Abimereki Muzaale: the pink zone, and you feel victory around here when you&#39;re almost hitting the green zone. Yeah. the feeling of victory.

70
00:09:04.470 --&gt; 00:09:10.430
Abimereki Muzaale: and only be produced if you felt anxious anxiety.

71
00:09:10.880 --&gt; 00:09:37.020
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, you can never fill victory unless you feel that anxiety and I&#39;ve overcome the victory is overcoming a challenge, whether it&#39;s a challenger in war or in sports, definitely what is the best example? But in modern life, where there&#39;s less war, these sports or politics challenger rifle.

72
00:09:37.030 --&gt; 00:09:41.959
Abimereki Muzaale: When you win, you move from a zone of anxiety to victory. Yeah.

73
00:09:41.990 --&gt; 00:09:43.530
Patrick: hmm,

74
00:09:43.850 --&gt; 00:09:52.010
Abimereki Muzaale: And so this is only producible. If you&#39;re following the Yellow zone, the feeling, the psychology of victory.

75
00:09:52.080 --&gt; 00:10:02.530
Abimereki Muzaale: But if you rest in your laurels and as as a sitting, Sarah, and become bleed like a ship and follow some 23 for the rest of your life.

76
00:10:02.730 --&gt; 00:10:05.680
Abimereki Muzaale: You&#39;ve been in green green postures.

77
00:10:05.720 --&gt; 00:10:08.560
Abimereki Muzaale: steel waters. It means

78
00:10:08.680 --&gt; 00:10:20.619
Abimereki Muzaale: you are not going to seek bigger challenges again. Yeah. Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s why the song is roded because it connects.

79
00:10:20.620 --&gt; 00:10:41.319
Abimereki Muzaale: I would like most people, desire you hear people so. Oh, I want to retire. Yes, but then there&#39;s some people who will never be content as soon as they finish. Yeah, exactly as soon as experience victory

80
00:10:41.320 --&gt; 00:10:45.440
Abimereki Muzaale: to them. There&#39;s only one meaning. I need a higher challenge.

81
00:10:45.560 --&gt; 00:10:49.740
Abimereki Muzaale: You change environment.

82
00:10:49.890 --&gt; 00:11:09.870
Abimereki Muzaale: you change. And the chat engine

83
00:11:09.880 --&gt; 00:11:26.719
Abimereki Muzaale: they but the other thing that I haven&#39;t shown here is what are the molecules? Molecular changes in the brain that goes anxiety? So it&#39;s nora adrenaline. It&#39;s a molecule that has a modification of adrenaline for noradrenaline adrenaline doesn&#39;t get to the brain.

84
00:11:27.120 --&gt; 00:11:29.830
Abimereki Muzaale: it&#39;s in the rest of the body.

85
00:11:30.100 --&gt; 00:11:42.550
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no, no! Produced by the body. Coffee is not produced by the body. Yes.

86
00:11:42.680 --&gt; 00:11:44.200
Abimereki Muzaale: so

87
00:11:44.260 --&gt; 00:11:58.190
Abimereki Muzaale: sort of yeah. So some things we produce anxiety. But the best examples of anxiety. Things that produce anxiety are real life challenges. That is so important, I think, your skills, your skills are not sufficient.

88
00:11:58.220 --&gt; 00:12:14.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, if the line jumps into the room right now, I worry. Yeah, that&#39;s a challenge. I understand very well. And I can tell you, sort of relevant to you civilized modern person. You really don&#39;t have the skills

89
00:12:14.560 --&gt; 00:12:21.920
Abimereki Muzaale: 200 lines. So you&#39;ve been actual. I in in medicine, they say. They call adrenaline in the fight.

90
00:12:22.120 --&gt; 00:12:32.369
Abimereki Muzaale: Fright, flight home on you get into the mode of fighting, or fly flying away fright or getting scared fright.

91
00:12:32.390 --&gt; 00:12:35.139
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s what adrenaline does. So that&#39;s a rig song

92
00:12:35.180 --&gt; 00:12:40.870
Abimereki Muzaale: the the green zone of boredom. The molecule is called and and

93
00:12:40.930 --&gt; 00:12:43.279
Abimereki Muzaale: it&#39;s a molecule. N, mda.

94
00:12:43.310 --&gt; 00:13:00.100
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, we know. What is it? Gaba? Gaba gamma? The third Greek letter am mine will be tyric acid. Gaba GABA. Gamma B Tyric acid. It&#39;s the molecules produced when you take volume.

95
00:13:00.720 --&gt; 00:13:08.039
Abimereki Muzaale: Volume is yes, it makes you sleep alcohol.

96
00:13:08.130 --&gt; 00:13:22.839
Abimereki Muzaale: What&#39;s exactly the same as volume in the same exact location as a brain that. So alcohol because of relaxation. That&#39;s why it&#39;s the most famous beverage on the planet. Every culture

97
00:13:23.000 --&gt; 00:13:25.690
Abimereki Muzaale: alcohol is very popular because

98
00:13:25.940 --&gt; 00:13:29.200
Abimereki Muzaale: people are stressed. Yeah.

99
00:13:29.580 --&gt; 00:13:32.460
if you want a quick fix

100
00:13:32.670 --&gt; 00:13:39.860
Abimereki Muzaale: when you&#39;re anxious. I can assure you. Yeah, human, you might need to figure it out

101
00:13:39.980 --&gt; 00:13:51.619
Abimereki Muzaale: a long time ago. It&#39;s called alcohol. Yeah. Well, that that&#39;s a moral judgment. Biology, molecular biology. Yeah.

102
00:13:51.870 --&gt; 00:13:53.990
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, molecular biology.

103
00:13:54.100 --&gt; 00:13:57.170
Abimereki Muzaale: That it is very effective

104
00:13:57.190 --&gt; 00:14:04.119
Abimereki Muzaale: volume is manufactured. But alcohol is a product of nature, as in what&#39;s called fermentation.

105
00:14:04.140 --&gt; 00:14:15.419
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So the human race discovered ages ago. That&#39;s why it shows up in Scripture, I think probably never is.

106
00:14:15.460 --&gt; 00:14:21.600
Abimereki Muzaale: because it&#39;s going to be abused has to be abused because there&#39;s a lot of anxiety, a lot of stress.

107
00:14:21.650 --&gt; 00:14:27.299
Abimereki Muzaale: And if you discover the ultimate solution, it&#39;s not an ultimate solution. It just takes away the feeling

108
00:14:27.520 --&gt; 00:14:53.490
Abimereki Muzaale: it takes with the molecule. Yeah, but it doesn&#39;t solve any problem adrenaline and produces gaba tyric acid, which is the molecule for relaxation, the feeling of relaxation. But the yellow zone, the molecule is called dopamine.

109
00:14:53.940 --&gt; 00:14:59.029
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, actually, it&#39;s what&#39;s released when you eat for a good meal. Huh!

110
00:14:59.190 --&gt; 00:15:01.960
Abimereki Muzaale: Or when you&#39;re victorious, literally.

111
00:15:02.220 --&gt; 00:15:21.260
Abimereki Muzaale: So, yeah, you get that. But guess what alcohol also produces. Dopamine really causes what it really is. Dopamine. So but there are many other drugs of abuse, most drugs of abuse in a yellow produce dopamine.

112
00:15:21.360 --&gt; 00:15:23.139
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s why they&#39;re dangerous.

113
00:15:23.220 --&gt; 00:15:27.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Because if you can get victory, a feeling of victory without any effort.

114
00:15:28.200 --&gt; 00:15:30.220
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s good. You&#39;re going to abuse that

115
00:15:30.590 --&gt; 00:15:33.440
Abimereki Muzaale: you get hooked on. It

116
00:15:33.490 --&gt; 00:15:49.839
Abimereki Muzaale: does not produce feeling of victory actually may create anxiety. However.

117
00:15:49.890 --&gt; 00:16:00.580
Abimereki Muzaale: if you&#39;re taking the coffee with explicit purpose of overcoming the challenge. and you&#39;re focusing. it&#39;s going to drive it towards victory.

118
00:16:01.110 --&gt; 00:16:12.220
Abimereki Muzaale: And the you will repeat, you&#39;ll hit, repeat, just keep it me. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done since May. For me it is mostly anxiety, as in the class of people are off my edge

119
00:16:12.450 --&gt; 00:16:17.890
Abimereki Muzaale: and I could not understand a single thing in data sciences. I all the time.

120
00:16:17.970 --&gt; 00:16:22.409
Abimereki Muzaale: II remember the first lecture. I literally understood exactly 0.

121
00:16:23.000 --&gt; 00:16:27.400
Abimereki Muzaale: Everything that has mentioned they would talk of

122
00:16:27.440 --&gt; 00:16:36.370
Abimereki Muzaale: the time. I don&#39;t use the Times because I didn&#39;t understand them. You may not understand them, too. But all the things I picked

123
00:16:36.470 --&gt; 00:16:49.969
Abimereki Muzaale: II had call up is that&#39;s the place where, if for status, for status, you want to try, call up. But you do not want that&#39;s you walk for should evolve to Vs code. I wrote that down.

124
00:16:50.040 --&gt; 00:16:59.980
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I didn&#39;t understand anything that was being said. But I wrote that down. I was like, Oh, so if you novice call up. So I went to call up. I just very straightforward let Google call up. That&#39;s our recommended

125
00:17:00.250 --&gt; 00:17:15.380
Abimereki Muzaale: because you can literally go ahead.

126
00:17:15.500 --&gt; 00:17:21.220
Abimereki Muzaale: This is being recorded. And you know, let me record a shorter video because this video will be too long.

127
00:17:21.440 --&gt; 00:17:30.839
Abimereki Muzaale:  no. You showed us the code before you showed us the graph. No, what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m going to record the process of reproducing this graph.

128
00:17:31.140 --&gt; 00:17:35.079
Patrick: Okay, did you? Did you send that code? Also by email?

129
00:17:35.130 --&gt; 00:17:45.269
sarahkayongo: I want the quote, I&#39;m going to reproduce the process now. So just relax.

130
00:17:45.380 --&gt; 00:17:55.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Don&#39;t worry about it. Just just okay. Any.

131
00:17:55.640 --&gt; 00:17:58.420
sarahkayongo: Do you? Do you write code? P.

132
00:17:58.950 --&gt; 00:18:21.979
Abimereki Muzaale: Very small code? Not not Major smart major questions irrelevant because this AI, which is so advanced. Now, it&#39;s a very relevant question. Do you write code? So Uhhuh, step number one, go to Google, step number 2,

133
00:18:22.260 --&gt; 00:18:26.020
Abimereki Muzaale: call up. Welcome to cool up

134
00:18:27.170 --&gt; 00:18:29.380
Abimereki Muzaale: file file.

135
00:18:29.540 --&gt; 00:18:40.060
Abimereki Muzaale: And I&#39;m gonna record this and put it together. I&#39;ve hit file.

136
00:18:40.250 --&gt; 00:18:42.280
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m going to copy and paste

137
00:18:42.470 --&gt; 00:18:46.489
Abimereki Muzaale: from here. So you see the code that produced this is python. Yeah.

138
00:18:46.530 --&gt; 00:18:48.470
Abimereki Muzaale: copy. Excellent.

139
00:18:48.590 --&gt; 00:18:55.500
Abimereki Muzaale: I think the language the most popular. Second, most popular language is number one is Javascript. Copied

140
00:18:59.130 --&gt; 00:19:07.220
Abimereki Muzaale: paste it? Oh, no knowledge. You don&#39;t even know any of this knowledge here. Produced.

141
00:19:07.380 --&gt; 00:19:11.109
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, how about that? You can download this image.

142
00:19:11.220 --&gt; 00:19:18.130
Abimereki Muzaale: or which I strongly recommend, you can export it to your Github account. Yeah, okay.

143
00:19:18.370 --&gt; 00:19:25.729
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. So any, I&#39;m gonna stop the recording there because it&#39;s doing this for demonstration purposes. That&#39;s a 1 min video

144
00:19:27.330 --&gt; 00:19:28.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Hmm.

145
00:19:29.130 --&gt; 00:19:35.820
sarahkayongo: You know, you should be teaching this on a on you to.

146
00:19:35.880 --&gt; 00:19:46.330
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s what I&#39;m going. Where do you think I&#39;m going to put videos, anyway?

147
00:19:47.100 --&gt; 00:19:59.359
sarahkayongo: no, not not really posting these videos, but create. Once I learn how to code and come up with interactive things.

148
00:19:59.560 --&gt; 00:20:11.219
Abimereki Muzaale: But I know there are so many videos on Youtube instructional videos on how. So? So this one don&#39;t put this on Youtube, I&#39;m gonna put this on my Youtube. I created a Youtube account.

149
00:20:11.390 --&gt; 00:20:16.360
Abimereki Muzaale:  so what I&#39;m going to do is upload this.

150
00:20:17.260 --&gt; 00:20:20.320
Abimereki Muzaale: Even, I&#39;m going to do this in real time. So I just see

152
00:20:26.150 --&gt; 00:20:32.220
Abimereki Muzaale: And so let&#39;s just see this process in real time. Yeah. you, too.

153
00:20:33.780 --&gt; 00:20:53.710
Abimereki Muzaale: I use the first person I was so creating a Youtube account was Lauren. I think she was like 4, 5 years old. But before, when I knew what she was doing didn&#39;t make any sense at the time.

154
00:20:53.750 --&gt; 00:20:59.029
Abimereki Muzaale: But generation was already doing these things

155
00:20:59.060 --&gt; 00:21:11.169
Abimereki Muzaale: Youtube channels like, what is a Youtube channel? Didn&#39;t make any sense. But now I see I&#39;m pretty content for students. So whoever, even in this case for you.

156
00:21:11.490 --&gt; 00:21:20.760
Abimereki Muzaale:  so you see, create upload videos  I&#39;m going to find this video.

157
00:21:21.980 --&gt; 00:21:24.520
Abimereki Muzaale: I just need to find where it&#39;s recorded.

158
00:21:25.810 --&gt; 00:21:27.270
Abimereki Muzaale: I can&#39;t remember.

159
00:21:28.540 --&gt; 00:21:34.079
Abimereki Muzaale: But I&#39;m going to upload it. Do you have access to the the the shared notes.

160
00:21:35.640 --&gt; 00:21:37.690
Patrick: Okay, you send us the email

161
00:21:38.290 --&gt; 00:21:39.110
Abimereki Muzaale: that&#39;s

162
00:21:39.510 --&gt; 00:21:52.100
Abimereki Muzaale: in zoom. I gave you that in zoom. Yes, I got zoom. I got it, but I prefer you share in the email cause. This will go the moment I turn off. Well, by the link that is not going to die. Yeah, what I&#39;m saying is that link is

163
00:21:52.110 --&gt; 00:21:54.860
Abimereki Muzaale: a real link. So if you save it somewhere

164
00:21:54.910 --&gt; 00:21:59.789
Abimereki Muzaale: you can access it anytime cause it will have this video that I&#39;m going to share.

165
00:22:00.690 --&gt; 00:22:01.950
Patrick: Does that make sense?

166
00:22:02.790 --&gt; 00:22:07.429
sarahkayongo: Talking of coffee? Let me let me get make some coffee, I think.

167
00:22:07.610 --&gt; 00:22:11.680
Abimereki Muzaale: Actually, me, I&#39;m experimenting walking like coffee. It&#39;s a challenge

168
00:22:11.960 --&gt; 00:22:17.790
sarahkayongo: really drunk. Actually, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll sleep after this. I don&#39;t have any.

169
00:22:17.870 --&gt; 00:22:20.379
you know. I thought it&#39;s almost morning

170
00:22:20.620 --&gt; 00:22:22.100
sarahkayongo: that&#39;s really bad.

171
00:22:22.270 --&gt; 00:22:26.789
Abimereki Muzaale: Please the video, it&#39;s time for sleep.

172
00:22:27.260 --&gt; 00:22:30.930
sarahkayongo: Okay, so yeah.

173
00:22:31.010 --&gt; 00:22:34.599
Abimereki Muzaale: picture view, that&#39;s not a picture. This one is a video

174
00:22:34.620 --&gt; 00:22:36.340
Abimereki Muzaale: to the video.

175
00:22:36.850 --&gt; 00:22:38.570
Patrick: which one is that?

176
00:22:38.680 --&gt; 00:22:40.239
Abimereki Muzaale: No. And I&#39;ve just recorded

177
00:22:40.560 --&gt; 00:22:42.850
Patrick: that they support that. So

178
00:22:42.960 --&gt; 00:22:51.650
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m now going to upload it into Youtube only to get a URL, which I&#39;m going to embed with the

179
00:22:53.080 --&gt; 00:22:55.669
Abimereki Muzaale: you can now use it.

180
00:22:56.570 --&gt; 00:22:59.310
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so what is this about?

181
00:23:00.090 --&gt; 00:23:01.839
Call up Google callup.

182
00:23:02.990 --&gt; 00:23:03.810
Patrick: Hmm!

183
00:23:04.590 --&gt; 00:23:07.810
Oh, love! So

184
00:23:08.150 --&gt; 00:23:10.830
sarahkayongo: he were trying to wait for joining.

185
00:23:12.050 --&gt; 00:23:14.730
Patrick: hey? He&#39;s be awake.

186
00:23:14.900 --&gt; 00:23:16.960
Abimereki Muzaale: No, he&#39;s at the airport

187
00:23:17.280 --&gt; 00:23:21.249
Patrick: to drop Brand at the airport.

188
00:23:23.080 --&gt; 00:23:24.000
Okay?

189
00:23:25.330 --&gt; 00:23:30.449
sarahkayongo: But I mean, if we can start after this.

190
00:23:30.710 --&gt; 00:23:32.080
Patrick: Yes.

191
00:23:34.100 --&gt; 00:23:35.210
Abimereki Muzaale: next.

192
00:23:35.450 --&gt; 00:23:39.670
sarahkayongo: you can always read the the notes or join us.

193
00:23:40.880 --&gt; 00:23:43.599
sarahkayongo: Yeah, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m tired today.

194
00:23:44.870 --&gt; 00:23:47.010
Abimereki Muzaale: Hi, Evan. Yeah.

195
00:23:47.310 --&gt; 00:23:58.220
sarahkayongo: Greetings from all your cousins in in Europe. Welcome back! We&#39;ll come back. Those are excellent photos and wonderful moments.

196
00:23:58.470 --&gt; 00:24:02.610
Patrick: This is just so good to see joy. I&#39;ve taken so long that seeing Joy.

197
00:24:03.570 --&gt; 00:24:06.840
Patrick: did you know? Huh?

198
00:24:07.190 --&gt; 00:24:10.089
Maybe I&#39;ve I&#39;ve spent time with that in the Uk.

199
00:24:10.120 --&gt; 00:24:25.169
Patrick: Oh, I went. Yes, I went to say so much, Cindy, she eventually called her. She came up and picked me up, took me for lunch at her home. Then she also is. Then, on the next day, who took me out to see London.

200
00:24:26.000 --&gt; 00:24:27.570
Patrick: Yeah, she cooked for me.

201
00:24:27.610 --&gt; 00:24:29.479
sarahkayongo: She&#39;s a good cook.

202
00:24:29.970 --&gt; 00:24:30.690
Patrick: Yeah.

203
00:24:30.910 --&gt; 00:24:36.109
Patrick: she she it was just so good being with those guys. It was so long.

204
00:24:36.900 --&gt; 00:24:55.539
Patrick: although I found not just seeing this daughter one of not seeing these daughters to be very, very in another world. I don&#39;t know what her issue is. I last met her

205
00:24:55.560 --&gt; 00:24:58.160
Abimereki Muzaale: 4 years old. Adventures too much.

206
00:24:58.290 --&gt; 00:25:00.329
Patrick: because just too much. Yeah.

207
00:25:00.750 --&gt; 00:25:03.040
Patrick: May met as a teenager.

208
00:25:03.060 --&gt; 00:25:16.000
Patrick: Yeah. So she just hungry. She, the mother, talks to her, she walks, away she goes, locks herself in the room, man from morning up to evening, then at night she has disappeared.

209
00:25:16.290 --&gt; 00:25:18.820
Patrick: Then, opening later.

210
00:25:19.670 --&gt; 00:25:21.429
Patrick: just saved money

211
00:25:21.930 --&gt; 00:25:27.949
Patrick: of the football.

212
00:25:28.160 --&gt; 00:25:33.280
Patrick: Inegelda. That one I spent so much time with her. She&#39;s so friendly. She&#39;s

213
00:25:33.300 --&gt; 00:25:35.210
Patrick: she&#39;s just such a good person

214
00:25:35.330 --&gt; 00:25:37.930
Patrick: is a nice to hunt government.

215
00:25:38.400 --&gt; 00:25:41.679
Patrick: She she will give her life to Christ, but I think

216
00:25:41.820 --&gt; 00:25:47.489
Patrick: the parents may not have liked that, so they quickly took her to Catholic Semi Seminary and

217
00:25:47.510 --&gt; 00:25:49.580
Patrick: quickly, Bubday&#39;s yeah.

218
00:25:50.790 --&gt; 00:25:54.519
sarahkayongo: The father was. The father is a Catholic Catholic.

219
00:25:55.160 --&gt; 00:26:01.799
sarahkayongo: I do not know who has. Yes, so many questions.

220
00:26:01.940 --&gt; 00:26:09.980
and later on she said she wanted to give her life to Christ, and we did. We prayed. we prayed together, and she received Christ. So

221
00:26:10.090 --&gt; 00:26:12.569
Patrick: when this thing was done so speedy.

222
00:26:12.740 --&gt; 00:26:20.869
Patrick: I say, now, what is this? This is not good. But anyway, since she made that decision herself to give her life to Christ.

223
00:26:21.080 --&gt; 00:26:23.349
sarahkayongo: I know that God will take care of that.

224
00:26:23.380 --&gt; 00:26:28.450
Patrick: Yeah, she was there.

225
00:26:29.250 --&gt; 00:26:32.859
sarahkayongo: She&#39;s a very nice girl, you know. She went to law school.

226
00:26:34.010 --&gt; 00:26:35.820
Yes, she is a lawyer.

227
00:26:36.280 --&gt; 00:26:39.860
sarahkayongo: Hmm! Very smart.

228
00:26:40.030 --&gt; 00:26:41.640
Patrick: very shy.

229
00:26:41.840 --&gt; 00:26:47.819
sarahkayongo: She&#39;s a lot, but she was telling me she hated law, so she&#39;s not

230
00:26:47.840 --&gt; 00:26:51.629
Patrick: after training. She&#39;s probably not going to practice it.

231
00:26:52.410 --&gt; 00:26:56.810
sarahkayongo: Yeah, I know. I know so many lawyers who end up not

232
00:26:57.000 --&gt; 00:27:00.949
sarahkayongo: every field, every field has people who don&#39;t practice

233
00:27:01.630 --&gt; 00:27:28.689
Patrick: even medicine. I&#39;m not practicing engineering school. When I finish electrical engineering, I decided

234
00:27:29.080 --&gt; 00:27:34.079
Patrick: I didn&#39;t even go. I just went, picked up my certificate. And that was

235
00:27:34.200 --&gt; 00:27:35.010
Patrick: yeah.

236
00:27:36.130 --&gt; 00:27:51.270
sarahkayongo: Well, I&#39;m doing research. I find I find it more engaging type of flow. Well, no, I&#39;m not practice. But I&#39;m not practicing. I&#39;m not seeing patience.

237
00:27:51.280 --&gt; 00:27:58.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I&#39;m finding solutions for patients. That. The the profession doesn&#39;t have solutions, for that&#39;s why research is

238
00:27:58.470 --&gt; 00:28:03.670
sarahkayongo: so. But did you enjoy the clinical?

239
00:28:03.800 --&gt; 00:28:13.490
Abimereki Muzaale: Of course I did. Very good with patience. Very good. That much I, Patience, told me. don&#39;t you miss it? No.

240
00:28:14.120 --&gt; 00:28:37.750
Abimereki Muzaale: so you let me tell you about flow zones and boredom, and what professions are not for everyone, not for me, for sure, because I can&#39;t do routine for the rest of my life. Routines and exactly 0 creativity. As long as you&#39;re creative you are in trouble being sued first of all, because a professional inherit is inherited knowledge and wisdom

241
00:28:37.880 --&gt; 00:28:42.219
Abimereki Muzaale: it said about your ideas, yeah, it&#39;s what&#39;s proven.

242
00:28:42.810 --&gt; 00:28:45.259
Abimereki Muzaale: And so you&#39;re supposed to abide.

243
00:28:45.580 --&gt; 00:28:53.759
Abimereki Muzaale: Bring us? Why is your wisdom? That&#39;s that&#39;s so. In place like the Us. You&#39;re just exposing yourself to lawsuits.

244
00:28:53.810 --&gt; 00:28:55.589
Abimereki Muzaale: If anything goes wrong.

245
00:28:55.680 --&gt; 00:29:00.340
Abimereki Muzaale: and you did things out of line with your profession, with guidelines of your hospitals.

246
00:29:00.500 --&gt; 00:29:01.529
Abimereki Muzaale: You&#39;re done.

247
00:29:02.160 --&gt; 00:29:03.040
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

248
00:29:03.780 --&gt; 00:29:23.060
sarahkayongo: So you guys are making me feel good. Me? I chose. Actually, I wanted to be a lawyer. No, no. As a child I wanted to be a doctor. Believe it or not.

249
00:29:23.770 --&gt; 00:29:32.489
sarahkayongo: he used to expose us. He would ask us what we wanted to to be when we grew up and under before maybe

250
00:29:33.080 --&gt; 00:29:34.919
sarahkayongo: half of you are born.

251
00:29:35.830 --&gt; 00:29:42.690
sarahkayongo: So in Malaga they took us to the Mall. He just would take us to be exposed.

252
00:29:42.880 --&gt; 00:29:45.459
sarahkayongo: and then went to the Monterey.

253
00:29:46.050 --&gt; 00:29:49.779
sarahkayongo: and I said, No, I cannot deal with that.

254
00:29:51.810 --&gt; 00:29:52.719
Abimereki Muzaale: And

255
00:29:53.510 --&gt; 00:29:59.769
sarahkayongo: and then I think we also in high school. I do not have a good physics teacher.

256
00:30:00.350 --&gt; 00:30:01.969
sarahkayongo: physics of the

257
00:30:02.100 --&gt; 00:30:03.860
sarahkayongo: I enjoyed very much.

258
00:30:05.940 --&gt; 00:30:13.040
sarahkayongo: I actually enjoyed chemistry, but physics, Mr. Smini, who he was so mean.

259
00:30:13.810 --&gt; 00:30:24.670
sarahkayongo: So I enjoyed literature because it came naturally to me. But then I discovered economics, and then I and then

260
00:30:25.280 --&gt; 00:30:28.170
sarahkayongo: in Essex, 5.

261
00:30:28.450 --&gt; 00:30:32.099
sarahkayongo: Professor, what&#39;s his name? The one was the

262
00:30:32.200 --&gt; 00:30:36.039
sarahkayongo: one in 4. Roomba Hall.

263
00:30:36.490 --&gt; 00:30:40.680
Patrick: Yeah.

264
00:30:40.990 --&gt; 00:30:43.820
Patrick: yes, that

265
00:30:45.760 --&gt; 00:30:51.050
my wife had a shop in Chicago, and mommy said I should go help her.

266
00:30:51.480 --&gt; 00:30:53.969
sarahkayongo: And I went, and

267
00:30:54.620 --&gt; 00:30:57.600
sarahkayongo: I was 16. It&#39;s 4 voc

268
00:30:58.700 --&gt; 00:31:03.149
sarahkayongo: I was so so I was like, what&#39;s going on

269
00:31:03.480 --&gt; 00:31:09.619
sarahkayongo: anyway, would wake up in the morning, and these trucks would come and unload things.

270
00:31:10.040 --&gt; 00:31:23.989
sarahkayongo: you know, consume my goods, boxes or so matchboxes, whatever whatever people, and then, as soon as before, it was wholesale is wholesale.

271
00:31:24.100 --&gt; 00:31:26.970
sarahkayongo: so just by Bob says.

272
00:31:27.280 --&gt; 00:31:28.500
sarahkayongo: keep them.

273
00:31:28.630 --&gt; 00:31:31.589
sarahkayongo: and as soon as the trucks leave.

274
00:31:31.830 --&gt; 00:31:36.710
sarahkayongo: retailers from all over the country would come and buy the boxes

275
00:31:37.950 --&gt; 00:31:56.179
sarahkayongo: like, what&#39;s happening. Yeah, this is demand and supply, and and then the prices were set every day, and they would change, and I remember being 16 years old going to the neighbor, asking every

276
00:31:56.970 --&gt; 00:32:10.149
sarahkayongo: and then from every little chip retailer. That would be a slight difference.

277
00:32:10.340 --&gt; 00:32:18.099
sarahkayongo: maybe by a hundred shillings. So 200, you know their little permissions.

278
00:32:18.140 --&gt; 00:32:32.300
sarahkayongo: and from the end of Chico is narrow. These from the beginning of Chipova to the end, the price would change. Yeah, depending on on scarcity

279
00:32:32.450 --&gt; 00:32:39.540
sarahkayongo: depending on availability. I was so then I went to Essex, and I was studying economics

280
00:32:39.580 --&gt; 00:32:44.310
sarahkayongo: and everything I would understand demand and supply in my head.

281
00:32:44.590 --&gt; 00:32:46.379
Abimereki Muzaale: And it&#39;s like,

282
00:32:46.720 --&gt; 00:32:51.859
sarahkayongo: Wait a minute. That is what was happening. They will talk about hoarding.

283
00:32:51.940 --&gt; 00:32:53.979
sarahkayongo: So there was no doubt

284
00:32:54.220 --&gt; 00:33:00.790
sarahkayongo: I wanted to study business administration. That kind which was not even in market that time they had

285
00:33:01.210 --&gt; 00:33:03.029
Patrick: become us

286
00:33:03.050 --&gt; 00:33:05.270
sarahkayongo: some very archaic.

287
00:33:06.830 --&gt; 00:33:08.599
Patrick: very archaic program.

288
00:33:09.370 --&gt; 00:33:10.280
Abimereki Muzaale: No.

289
00:33:10.470 --&gt; 00:33:15.879
Abimereki Muzaale: what I&#39;m doing here, I&#39;m almost done here. I just want you going to find the video

290
00:33:16.110 --&gt; 00:33:22.769
Abimereki Muzaale:  available. Actually, if you click that link, I think.

291
00:33:23.440 --&gt; 00:33:27.610
Abimereki Muzaale: and if you can, you&#39;ll find Link you&#39;re working on now.

292
00:33:27.910 --&gt; 00:33:32.259
Abimereki Muzaale: I already worked in it. Ii just omitted something

293
00:33:34.250 --&gt; 00:33:38.949
sarahkayongo: So which other link are you talking about? The one you just posted?

294
00:33:40.330 --&gt; 00:33:43.139
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s a link. But I think it&#39;s a different page.

295
00:33:43.360 --&gt; 00:33:45.570
Abimereki Muzaale: I have to. Yeah.

296
00:33:45.730 --&gt; 00:33:47.449
Abimereki Muzaale: let me get the correct page.

297
00:33:50.830 --&gt; 00:33:53.339
sarahkayongo: I already had it open.

298
00:33:53.470 --&gt; 00:34:05.470
Abimereki Muzaale: You had it top end. But I don&#39;t think you have, either. I&#39;ve changed the page. So if you click on it, you want actually, I think what I shared may vanish. Because I have.

299
00:34:05.660 --&gt; 00:34:08.969
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, I fix this problem. That&#39;s just a slight problem.

300
00:34:09.449 --&gt; 00:34:12.580
Abimereki Muzaale: I have moved the link elsewhere. You&#39;ll find.

301
00:34:13.610 --&gt; 00:34:19.190
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, okay, okay. Now let me let me update it for you. I&#39;ll finish the necessary updates.

302
00:34:21.010 --&gt; 00:34:28.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Do you see, I&#39;m working from the time you know everything I&#39;m doing? I had no knowledge existed as of April this year.

303
00:34:28.780 --&gt; 00:34:32.839
Abimereki Muzaale: But now I have automated scripts, script automated.

304
00:34:33.080 --&gt; 00:34:35.180
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s going to update everything.

305
00:34:37.010 --&gt; 00:34:44.010
Abimereki Muzaale: And how do I know all this. This is all chat. Gp, just patient by calling for patience.

306
00:34:44.210 --&gt; 00:34:45.980
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

307
00:34:47.790 --&gt; 00:34:53.550
Abimereki Muzaale: So like, this is script. I walk together to chat, gpt on. I just give it gives me this prompt.

308
00:34:53.870 --&gt; 00:34:55.100
Abimereki Muzaale: and

309
00:34:55.530 --&gt; 00:35:02.880
Abimereki Muzaale: I fill out the prompts, and it does everything else, because everything else is so routine, others out of being the green zone board

310
00:35:03.020 --&gt; 00:35:07.470
Abimereki Muzaale: doing the same steps over and over again. So I automated them.

311
00:35:07.910 --&gt; 00:35:09.660
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

312
00:35:13.620 --&gt; 00:35:30.049

316
00:35:51.180 --&gt; 00:36:05.139
Abimereki Muzaale: that&#39;s a great example for the right crowd.

317
00:36:05.550 --&gt; 00:36:12.670
Abimereki Muzaale: II just you see, I just just occur to me that you, Charles, and I,

Patrick: a teacher teaching someone who is totally blank, blank, hard drive.

327
00:37:01.320 --&gt; 00:37:06.559
Patrick: Then you you start inputting knowledge. And after a year, 2 years.

328
00:37:06.820 --&gt; 00:37:09.129

Abimereki Muzaale: I just see Google watching the video. Someone is watching, looking at the say, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re looking at the same thing. I&#39;m seeing a Google search screen.

346
00:39:36.860 --&gt; 00:39:43.279
Patrick: Okay, I&#39;m stopping sharing now. And I&#39;m going to share again.

352
00:40:10.600 --&gt; 00:40:17.089
Abimereki Muzaale: But that&#39;s not the link I sent you, so you&#39;ll have to go. Oh, so go down, go down, down down on the left margin.

353
00:40:18.020 --&gt; 00:40:27.020

Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so yeah, so that&#39;s like a one and a half

356
00:40:39.550 --&gt; 00:40:44.480
Abimereki Muzaale: but anyway, so so the video.

357
00:40:44.490 --&gt; 00:40:59.609
sarahkayongo: the video, the entire process of me producing the video so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s very good.

358
00:41:00.200 --&gt; 00:41:10.910
Abimereki Muzaale: But the instructions are clear. Oh, yeah, II so this idea is, I&#39;m now learning to incorporate them into, as you can tell. This is my mode of communication. Now.

359
00:41:11.260 --&gt; 00:41:21.289
Abimereki Muzaale: Microsoft Office, Microsoft, Powerpoint excel. What else is there those for me that Pdf, that&#39;s history

360
00:41:21.590 --&gt; 00:41:28.040
Abimereki Muzaale: I communicate through HTML, because HTML is the language of the Internet.

361
00:41:28.260 --&gt; 00:41:32.369
Abimereki Muzaale: I, HTML can handle all kinds of media. You see, I can embed

362
00:41:32.490 --&gt; 00:41:39.860
Abimereki Muzaale: video embed anything in HTML. It&#39;s designed to take on anything

363
00:41:40.030 --&gt; 00:41:42.309
Abimereki Muzaale: because HTML, and so on is plain text

364
00:41:42.530 --&gt; 00:41:59.340
Abimereki Muzaale: but it it with capacity to take on anything. So for me, that&#39;s a revolution getting cause. That&#39;s that&#39;s what I pick from the data science class. They&#39;re teaching us machine learning and other things for me, just understanding

365
00:41:59.420 --&gt; 00:42:12.579
Abimereki Muzaale: that the Internet is HTML, which is a structure of the web page. Then it&#39;s Css cascading, whatever, for you know color. And you know. Gloss.

366
00:42:12.600 --&gt; 00:42:15.020
sarahkayongo: then Javascript for video.

367
00:42:15.380 --&gt; 00:42:18.479
Abimereki Muzaale: This is just lead and each other.

368
00:42:19.670 --&gt; 00:42:24.590
Abimereki Muzaale: and that we have Chat Gp, that I can ask for any information, and it gives me

369
00:42:24.600 --&gt; 00:42:33.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Gives me feedback, and that I can use Github to Host cause I&#39;m not paying for any of this. Urls right

370
00:42:34.400 --&gt; 00:42:52.150
Abimereki Muzaale: website. In fact, website even, is a very all, all concept to me. I create books, which is a richer thing. Right? Yeah. And Github will host them. Of course Microsoft is very happy to give you this for free, because they train their AI on all all your call. Everything is.

371
00:42:52.280 --&gt; 00:43:00.190
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s how the AI is a more advanced than anyone, because Github is where people programmers are the whole wall with their code.

372
00:43:00.250 --&gt; 00:43:21.220
Abimereki Muzaale: So Microsoft has an advantage. No one else has access to the almost yeah and so they, you know. So they give us free services in return. We give them free data for their training. Their AI. So the AI is called Github

373
00:43:21.330 --&gt; 00:43:22.430
Abimereki Muzaale: co-pilot.

374
00:43:23.010 --&gt; 00:43:24.090
Patrick: It&#39;s

375
00:43:24.180 --&gt; 00:43:28.740
Abimereki Muzaale: I pay $10 for it. And when I walk in this environment, let me show you.

376
00:43:29.030 --&gt; 00:43:37.830
Abimereki Muzaale: And this in the Microsoft environment. So this is these are things that are definitely coming to to the next version of windows.

377
00:43:37.920 --&gt; 00:43:40.750
Abimereki Muzaale: So this is Vs card. Yeah.

378
00:43:40.960 --&gt; 00:43:43.230
sarahkayongo: So if I&#39;m open.

379
00:43:43.360 --&gt; 00:43:45.600
Abimereki Muzaale: if I open

380
00:43:45.920 --&gt; 00:43:51.739
Abimereki Muzaale: a document, say, I use dot IP ui, and that&#39;s called

381
00:43:52.010 --&gt; 00:43:56.099
Abimereki Muzaale: Jupiter. This is this is the extension that&#39;s finding call out, Yeah.

382
00:43:56.790 --&gt; 00:43:57.450
hmm.

383
00:43:57.860 --&gt; 00:44:03.799
Abimereki Muzaale: if you start writing code, say, if you start writing code

384
00:44:04.500 --&gt; 00:44:05.990
Abimereki Muzaale: can&#39;t think of code

385
00:44:06.300 --&gt; 00:44:16.070
Abimereki Muzaale:  it. It was almost the same as the the place. I peste code in collab. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s it. But you see it completing my code here.

386
00:44:16.570 --&gt; 00:44:33.850
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you see, I&#39;m saying, put something called pandas. So I just hit. If I hit Tab it will complete I accept what is completed. Then I go look what suggesting things. So even if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. And

387
00:44:33.860 --&gt; 00:44:36.319
Abimereki Muzaale: and I just go next. Yeah.

388
00:44:36.330 --&gt; 00:44:45.809
Abimereki Muzaale: auto completion. That&#39;s so. It&#39;s called Github call up. It&#39;s developed for code. But actually, it also works for text.

389
00:44:46.030 --&gt; 00:44:58.759
Abimereki Muzaale: So if I move from. So this is, do you notice that this is the same as Google versus, zoom, yeah. So so I can go back here and just demonstrate. So I think I have this already in

390
00:44:58.850 --&gt; 00:45:03.979
Abimereki Muzaale: I can get so I can put my text here as well to do what? Yeah, to work.

391
00:45:04.500 --&gt; 00:45:05.649
Abimereki Muzaale: No more walk.

392
00:45:05.900 --&gt; 00:45:16.950
sarahkayongo: So they need to be translated into code. It can. So Texas text, yeah, text has nothing to do with with code. But

393
00:45:17.210 --&gt; 00:45:25.179
Abimereki Muzaale: does it edit my my text? That&#39;s the point I&#39;m trying to make. It was not trained for that, but it has, it has the skills to do. So

394
00:45:25.480 --&gt; 00:45:32.420
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, so, for instance, no, even not asking it, you would just suggest.

395
00:45:32.680 --&gt; 00:45:33.700
sarahkayongo: okay.

396
00:45:33.950 --&gt; 00:45:43.079
Abimereki Muzaale: so. So I want to understand. Now I&#39;ve understood. Github is the host space where you know.

397
00:45:43.410 --&gt; 00:45:54.010
sarahkayongo: And then python the language python is the language chat G. Ppt and AI, what&#39;s the language?

398
00:45:54.170 --&gt; 00:45:56.979
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, those are different. Ais. So

399
00:45:57.000 --&gt; 00:46:02.749
Abimereki Muzaale: so here. So here the environment, I&#39;m in locally on my computer

400
00:46:02.840 --&gt; 00:46:10.660
Abimereki Muzaale: using a extension dot, IPYN, B. That&#39;s ipython. Python is PY.

401
00:46:11.170 --&gt; 00:46:21.570
Abimereki Muzaale: This is an environment for python, but more than python, because it allows me to run to do Markdown Markdown is where I can just write text.

402
00:46:22.280 --&gt; 00:46:28.240
Abimereki Muzaale: The nice thing about text is that instead of working in Microsoft office, for instance. Yes.

403
00:46:28.940 --&gt; 00:46:31.239
Patrick: yeah, I can write. Yeah, I say.

404
00:46:31.310 --&gt; 00:46:32.880
Abimereki Muzaale: essay.

405
00:46:35.750 --&gt; 00:46:39.850
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, look at suggesting a topic to me. AI ethics.

406
00:46:39.890 --&gt; 00:46:43.180
sarahkayongo: Yeah, you know what? You know, what?

407
00:46:43.490 --&gt; 00:46:46.159
Abimereki Muzaale: Because the last thing I was writing.

408
00:46:46.180 --&gt; 00:46:51.480
Abimereki Muzaale: I was working at AI ethics so, but but

409
00:46:51.630 --&gt; 00:46:53.689
Abimereki Muzaale: so ethics

410
00:46:54.200 --&gt; 00:46:56.429
Abimereki Muzaale: AI ethics.

411
00:46:57.080 --&gt; 00:46:58.210
Abimereki Muzaale: Look.

412
00:46:58.540 --&gt; 00:47:02.760
Abimereki Muzaale: oops suggesting stuff. So if I the whole paragraph.

413
00:47:02.800 --&gt; 00:47:07.069
Abimereki Muzaale: So just then entire. So if I hit Tab, it&#39;s going to accept.

414
00:47:07.650 --&gt; 00:47:10.459
Abimereki Muzaale: So then I move to the next paragraph and continue.

415
00:47:11.710 --&gt; 00:47:12.640
Abimereki Muzaale: Now.

416
00:47:13.450 --&gt; 00:47:16.790
Abimereki Muzaale: look, Whoa suggesting.

417
00:47:17.100 --&gt; 00:47:24.530
Abimereki Muzaale: So it does not find, it seems almost addictive. One, but not yeah. The address of things was not designed for.

418
00:47:30.390 --&gt; 00:47:41.980
sarahkayongo: But I don&#39;t have enough content or things to work on. So, my, what do you mean? Content you have, Whoa! You can step from where you are with what you have.

419
00:47:42.000 --&gt; 00:47:55.139
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s where the you get the most value out of AI is small bits rather than big things. So I just start from scratch together. So what I wanted to show you is that the environment this is my local computer is

420
00:47:55.160 --&gt; 00:47:59.309
Abimereki Muzaale: the same sort of environment on Google call up, yeah.

421
00:48:00.220 --&gt; 00:48:01.140
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

422
00:48:01.410 --&gt; 00:48:02.270
sarahkayongo: Yeah.

423
00:48:02.640 --&gt; 00:48:04.800
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, I went to Google jokes.

424
00:48:05.360 --&gt; 00:48:12.609
Abimereki Muzaale: The idea that you interspass coded text is the modern, the modern web communication.

425
00:48:12.890 --&gt; 00:48:13.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

426
00:48:15.140 --&gt; 00:48:23.499
Abimereki Muzaale: if you want to hide the code. Now, if you look at the file extension, look at the file extension. You see the file extension.

427
00:48:23.800 --&gt; 00:48:28.110
Abimereki Muzaale: IPUN. B. Like Ipython notebook.

428
00:48:28.200 --&gt; 00:48:30.480
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s a sem file extension here.

429
00:48:30.740 --&gt; 00:48:33.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s ipine notebook.

430
00:48:33.710 --&gt; 00:48:43.240
Abimereki Muzaale: So the name that&#39;s a Jupiter book. That&#39;s the name. And just paste your code versus text. Howard versus text.

431
00:48:43.290 --&gt; 00:48:47.450
Abimereki Muzaale: And what you&#39;re looking at here is code and text.

432
00:48:47.520 --&gt; 00:48:52.640
Abimereki Muzaale: If you look at if you look at

433
00:48:53.620 --&gt; 00:49:09.140
Abimereki Muzaale: this resource, yeah. So, for instance, this is text, if I go to the previous page. this is text, yeah, there&#39;s no code here. Yeah. So the previous times. Now, I&#39;m updating content to include video.

434
00:49:09.260 --&gt; 00:49:14.179
Abimereki Muzaale: huh? And next, I&#39;m going to add text of our prayer requests.

435
00:49:14.340 --&gt; 00:49:20.639
Abimereki Muzaale: Then, if say, we need need a quote for something I&#39;d add quote, that&#39;s what&#39;s the tiny revolution

436
00:49:20.850 --&gt; 00:49:26.399
sarahkayongo: that. How do you? How do you compare this to Powerpoint? Yeah.

437
00:49:26.580 --&gt; 00:49:31.309
Abimereki Muzaale: to y dot? Pdf.

438
00:49:31.660 --&gt; 00:49:33.380
Abimereki Muzaale: you can&#39;t. There&#39;s no comparison.

439
00:49:33.450 --&gt; 00:49:35.929
sarahkayongo: Yeah. The the beauties.

440
00:49:36.000 --&gt; 00:49:54.519
sarahkayongo: the the level of interaction, an integration potentially communication. If if I was to share this by Pdf, by Wad.

441
00:49:54.560 --&gt; 00:50:12.899
Abimereki Muzaale: I love to use email or whatever, then I&#39;ll have to send you updates. Oh, here&#39;s the latest version. But you have the URL. You have the URL. You just keep using the URL. That&#39;s why, Pia said, telling you, oh, that if you&#39;re going to lose this link after we end the zoom call

442
00:50:13.050 --&gt; 00:50:16.709
Abimereki Muzaale: well, the link is going to be the same. So you may as well save it somewhere.

443
00:50:17.490 --&gt; 00:50:34.289
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done. Yes, because it&#39;s going to be the same link next week next year. Yeah, I mean, we can change. But for now that&#39;s what&#39;s going to be. So for me. Yes, for me. That&#39;s my later revolution the main thing is setting up a workflow.

444
00:50:35.000 --&gt; 00:50:44.489
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s why I need to do set up a workflow where you&#39;re like, okay, now say, if I&#39;m in a meeting, and I want to get notes. Where am I going to type them?

445
00:50:44.650 --&gt; 00:50:50.320
Abimereki Muzaale: Or if I&#39;m stay here in this prayer session, where am I going to type?

446
00:50:50.790 --&gt; 00:50:54.839
Abimereki Muzaale: If I&#39;m working my, this is where, how will I? How will I

447
00:50:54.860 --&gt; 00:51:03.749
Abimereki Muzaale: type? How will I produce this figure? That&#39;s the main idea. Setting up the workflow? How do I get code from Chat Gp.

448
00:51:04.170 --&gt; 00:51:18.370
Abimereki Muzaale: and how do I use? Where do I run it for me? My answer, so that as I give you for status Google call up. But I remember but ultimately your goal should be to walk locally. This is not call up. You see, I&#39;m working locally in my computer.

449
00:51:18.380 --&gt; 00:51:21.240
Abimereki Muzaale: Then I push it onto Github.

450
00:51:21.890 --&gt; 00:51:36.770
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So so setting up the workflow is once you comfortable with the workflow walking from your computer rather than from online but then pushing the content online you have arrived.

451
00:51:37.050 --&gt; 00:51:46.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. But online, I can tell you, if it&#39;s easier to walk online. In fact, I&#39;m getting second thoughts about this. If you go to Github.

452
00:51:47.700 --&gt; 00:51:48.830
Patrick: hmm!

453
00:51:49.040 --&gt; 00:51:53.939
Abimereki Muzaale: And then let me just choose a Spjd what&#39;s called a repo.

454
00:51:55.420 --&gt; 00:51:57.630
Abimereki Muzaale: And then I go to court

455
00:51:58.820 --&gt; 00:52:05.220
Abimereki Muzaale: something called code spaces. I&#39;m going to get something which looks identical to my local computer because it&#39;s all Microsoft.

456
00:52:05.410 --&gt; 00:52:16.040
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s Vs code on my computer. But look you, said Vs code, this is Vs code on Github identical. Yeah. What I have look has this exact folders

457
00:52:16.130 --&gt; 00:52:19.940
Abimereki Muzaale: it has the same video. Let&#39;s see.

458
00:52:20.290 --&gt; 00:52:23.659
sarahkayongo: So there, there, no issue between.

459
00:52:23.710 --&gt; 00:52:27.770
sarahkayongo: Wow, there are no issues of

460
00:52:29.090 --&gt; 00:52:32.459
sarahkayongo: there are no issues between.

461
00:52:32.860 --&gt; 00:52:55.799
Abimereki Muzaale: generally.

462
00:52:55.830 --&gt; 00:53:11.029
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. But generally, it&#39;s easy. Yeah, it&#39;s easier working in Mark, I can tell you that. But you can. Of course, this is Microsoft product. Obviously, you can work in Microsoft. But the the things that with Microsoft you have to get a Linux environment.

463
00:53:11.290 --&gt; 00:53:15.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, Matt is automatic is Linux already, automatically.

464
00:53:15.700 --&gt; 00:53:22.609
Abimereki Muzaale: But Microsoft, I don&#39;t know why they decided to set it up in a non Linux system. Because everything is linux

465
00:53:22.640 --&gt; 00:53:39.060
Abimereki Muzaale: in the Internet. I don&#39;t see any advantage it has for Microsoft users. It&#39;s just pain. And I speak as a person who is doing students who are Microsoft who are windows.

466
00:53:39.360 --&gt; 00:53:43.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, he was, he was more challenging. Giving them instruction.

467
00:53:44.240 --&gt; 00:53:48.820
because number one challenge, they have to create a Linux environment.

468
00:53:48.870 --&gt; 00:53:49.990
Abimereki Muzaale: A shell

469
00:53:50.120 --&gt; 00:53:58.860
Abimereki Muzaale: but but look! But look at this. PI wanted to show you that you. I just went to Github and created the same environment. I have locally

470
00:53:58.920 --&gt; 00:54:01.090
Patrick: so it&#39;s one way.

471
00:54:01.190 --&gt; 00:54:09.969
Abimereki Muzaale: So you see, on on a windows system, you don&#39;t have a forward slush. That&#39;s a Linux setting. You have a backslash, which is problematic

472
00:54:10.230 --&gt; 00:54:21.299
Abimereki Muzaale: you can do, Linux, because that&#39;s what the Linux environment and all unix shell commands. For that environment.

473
00:54:21.860 --&gt; 00:54:34.740
Abimereki Muzaale: They won&#39;t. We&#39;re not working an environment. Well, as far as I&#39;ve seen with students, I&#39;ve you. We will not walk in a windows environment like in a command line of windows. If you go and type out unix commands. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll walk

474
00:54:36.910 --&gt; 00:54:48.480
Patrick: on a on a of course they cannot work in a windows environment exactly yet, but if you want to use the commands in windows. You simply go and and run your your command in in

475
00:54:48.820 --&gt; 00:55:05.559
Abimereki Muzaale: so those are things now, maybe not better, because you&#39;ve been working in a windows environment. So those are things you don&#39;t think of with Mac, because it is in a Linux environment. What&#39;s all computers are Linux except Microsoft.

476
00:55:05.820 --&gt; 00:55:15.049
Abimereki Muzaale: So I don&#39;t. But any. So instead, without worrying about what operating system you&#39;re on. if you create a but account.

477
00:55:15.420 --&gt; 00:55:26.759
Abimereki Muzaale: you have access to just go to. You see, I went to, I just logged into Github and I went to code and click code spaces. And it created this environment which is identical.

478
00:55:27.200 --&gt; 00:55:30.459
Abimereki Muzaale: You tell me if you can see in my local computer.

479
00:55:30.540 --&gt; 00:55:35.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Look, let me put them side by side. You can. They&#39;re all Microsoft.

480
00:55:36.070 --&gt; 00:55:38.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Look.

481
00:55:38.530 --&gt; 00:55:51.269
sarahkayongo: you can&#39;t.

482
00:55:51.690 --&gt; 00:55:55.050
sarahkayongo: So you see.

483
00:55:55.120 --&gt; 00:56:01.809
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. So so this, this is, this is a Vs code on Github. This is Vs code

484
00:56:01.990 --&gt; 00:56:09.780
Abimereki Muzaale: on my computer. So same thing in the bottom, right corner in the bottom we have it have a terminal.

485
00:56:10.040 --&gt; 00:56:13.090
Abimereki Muzaale: Linux, yeah, every time you know.

486
00:56:13.210 --&gt; 00:56:19.229
Abimereki Muzaale: if I type Ellis to see the what directory there it is.

487
00:56:19.460 --&gt; 00:56:24.179
Abimereki Muzaale: same here I&#39;m the same folders. Am I in the same folders? Or

488
00:56:24.250 --&gt; 00:56:27.769
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I&#39;m in a sub folder called sips.

489
00:56:28.260 --&gt; 00:56:30.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, same stuff. Look.

490
00:56:31.490 --&gt; 00:56:36.599
Patrick: because all my local com content, I push onto Github.

491
00:56:36.790 --&gt; 00:56:49.830
Abimereki Muzaale: So here I&#39;ve just gone straight to Github. But the content is the same. You see, these are the folders, the 7 folders from 0 to 6, and the one we&#39;re using. If I go to 7, one, that&#39;s all the prayer, prayer requests and stuff

492
00:56:50.070 --&gt; 00:56:52.070
Abimereki Muzaale: from May 2021

493
00:56:52.120 --&gt; 00:56:57.220
Abimereki Muzaale: if I go here to 6, 7, one for a request.

494
00:56:58.500 --&gt; 00:57:00.520
Much so same content.

495
00:57:00.700 --&gt; 00:57:23.979
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;ve been working from lo locally to online. That&#39;s the I ideal, at least, for now I think it&#39;s the ideal workflow where you work locally, then push online. But for as you establish cause, it&#39;s a painful process. What pushing from content from locally to github cause you have to use 2 part authentication

496
00:57:24.130 --&gt; 00:57:31.669
Abimereki Muzaale: which for me, I have an automatic script that&#39;s doing all that. But it was a painful process setting up that process, that automation

497
00:57:31.960 --&gt; 00:57:37.729
Abimereki Muzaale: but before you set up that process you can go straight to Github and walk from there.

498
00:57:38.600 --&gt; 00:57:47.260
Abimereki Muzaale: So call up is a nice nice landing place. Start with, call up to see how you can copy and paste code from Chat Gpt.

499
00:57:47.300 --&gt; 00:58:09.460
Abimereki Muzaale: When you&#39;re comfortable there. Then open a Github account and do something more advanced. Yeah, I have a shell pull up. I think I am ready to move to the next level. Oh, yeah, then then do Github, because with Github, then you have this exact environment which you will later have locally. And you can start using a shell terminal.

500
00:58:09.710 --&gt; 00:58:10.620
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah?

501
00:58:10.770 --&gt; 00:58:18.409
Abimereki Muzaale: And and also, yeah, anytime, you know. Once this is set up, then you can you be. You&#39;ll have set the stage for going locally.

502
00:58:18.630 --&gt; 00:58:26.129
Abimereki Muzaale: and the main thing about locally is just convincing your Github account that you&#39;re the owner of the account from your computer.

503
00:58:26.180 --&gt; 00:58:36.629
Abimereki Muzaale: And that process has been involved. I have a automated script. I can show you. It may not make any sense, but I developed it over a week period of a week

504
00:58:36.780 --&gt; 00:58:42.440
Abimereki Muzaale: with Chad. Gpt. Automated script that.

505
00:58:42.860 --&gt; 00:58:44.409
like this script.

506
00:58:44.510 --&gt; 00:58:48.810
Abimereki Muzaale: The language, right languages is, yeah, this is Linux or unix.

507
00:58:49.050 --&gt; 00:58:52.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, automated. So it gives you this prompt

508
00:58:53.370 --&gt; 00:59:02.970
Abimereki Muzaale: and you may. In fact, the video I made you see me filling out prompts. What&#39;s the Github username? What&#39;s the repository name? What&#39;s the email address?

509
00:59:03.090 --&gt; 00:59:07.359
Abimereki Muzaale: Those prompts? They need to run the script because of the inputs required.

510
00:59:08.220 --&gt; 00:59:20.659
Abimereki Muzaale: Directory. Are you working on your computer? What&#39;s the folder name? What&#39;s the these are the keys, the Double Industry Level authentication keys I can show you the sort of passwords which are

511
00:59:20.680 --&gt; 00:59:23.170
Abimereki Muzaale: industry standard

512
00:59:24.160 --&gt; 00:59:25.270
Abimereki Muzaale: like

513
00:59:26.620 --&gt; 00:59:27.779
is that

514
00:59:30.060 --&gt; 00:59:34.909
Patrick: I&#39;m going to arrange to have a separate time with you on this matter.

515
00:59:34.920 --&gt; 00:59:48.720
Patrick: Yeah, cause we are going to have to need to pray and then get ready. Or let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s do that here to look at. These are my, my private keys that give me access

516
00:59:49.000 --&gt; 01:00:01.020
Abimereki Muzaale: complex, whatever it is. Exactly. So you have. These are called private keys locally in my computer this. It&#39;s paired to another key on Github. So that&#39;s information

517
01:00:01.170 --&gt; 01:00:05.180
Abimereki Muzaale: to be able to access your github from your computer who squinted fat.

518
01:00:05.370 --&gt; 01:00:15.510
Abimereki Muzaale: So that&#39;s a thing that that relationship is called Pki public key infrastructure. Where your private key has too much.

519
01:00:15.670 --&gt; 01:00:20.210
Patrick: I need us to match your in order for you to be authenticated.

520
01:00:20.260 --&gt; 01:00:21.580
Abimereki Muzaale: So you call it what?

521
01:00:22.450 --&gt; 01:00:23.680
Pki.

522
01:00:24.270 --&gt; 01:00:26.509
Patrick: I need this key infrastructure.

523
01:00:26.740 --&gt; 01:00:32.679
Patrick: I need to use this language you&#39;re going to.

524
01:00:32.980 --&gt; 01:00:54.869
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you see that completion? The auto completion. Yeah, yeah. Wow. This language for a grant I&#39;m applying for. Because I I&#39;m going small business. Grant, I&#39;m gonna have to create a business this. Grants for business. Small businesses have ideas, anyway. Let&#39;s get to pray.

525
01:00:54.950 --&gt; 01:01:02.699
Patrick: thank you. Now, now, if I want to get a grant to help me finish my studies and start a project. What do I do?

526
01:01:02.940 --&gt; 01:01:22.199
Abimereki Muzaale: So the Grants generally that I have access to I think I&#39;m aware of, for now offer us citizens and so that so the question of collaboration is a different one, because professors at the School of Medicine at Mulago and School of Public Health have made a lot of money

527
01:01:22.460 --&gt; 01:01:27.539
Abimereki Muzaale: through collaborating with John Hopkins, for instance, who have grants who have access as citizens.

528
01:01:27.610 --&gt; 01:01:30.029
Abimereki Muzaale: So so you can have access

529
01:01:30.240 --&gt; 01:01:42.320
Abimereki Muzaale: through collaboration. So those are details. We can think we can explore, since I&#39;ve never thought in in terms of those lines. But I know, I know, I know.

530
01:01:43.040 --&gt; 01:01:43.830
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

531
01:01:44.840 --&gt; 01:02:03.840
sarahkayongo: However, I know my money.

532
01:02:04.590 --&gt; 01:02:08.240
Abimereki Muzaale: By collaborating with John Hopkins, professor

533
01:02:08.640 --&gt; 01:02:13.950
Abimereki Muzaale: who have access. So so the yeah, they&#39;re coin their core investigators.

534
01:02:14.090 --&gt; 01:02:15.879
Abimereki Muzaale: So well, then, let&#39;s see, yeah.

535
01:02:15.920 --&gt; 01:02:43.990
Abimereki Muzaale: they&#39;re co-investigators.

536
01:02:44.610 --&gt; 01:02:49.469
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, this is a generation that&#39;s invest 70.

537
01:02:49.690 --&gt; 01:02:52.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Then that&#39;s so many.

538
01:02:52.350 --&gt; 01:03:01.610
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Mid seventies. Maybe some. I you see how there&#39;s this was really time timing.

539
01:03:01.630 --&gt; 01:03:07.380
Abimereki Muzaale: It was HIV, because

540
01:03:07.420 --&gt; 01:03:11.380
Abimereki Muzaale: because HIV, because HIV hit the Us.

541
01:03:11.400 --&gt; 01:03:15.019
Abimereki Muzaale: 1981. Then it was discovered in Uganda.

542
01:03:15.380 --&gt; 01:03:17.849
sarahkayongo: My video was, oh.

543
01:03:17.900 --&gt; 01:03:22.760
Abimereki Muzaale: so American researchers came from Baltimore 2

544
01:03:22.940 --&gt; 01:03:31.209
sarahkayongo: even even. Larry was one of them. That&#39;s western. I remember

545
01:03:31.250 --&gt; 01:03:32.780
sarahkayongo: early nineties.

546
01:03:32.860 --&gt; 01:03:39.050
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So Larry was a John Hopkins people. Actually. Aj.

547
01:03:39.220 --&gt; 01:04:01.779
Abimereki Muzaale: you perfect timing. You guys missed exactly what he&#39;s not interested in.

548
01:04:01.780 --&gt; 01:04:09.469
Patrick: Okay, we&#39;ve been trying to establish. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t recognize this right.

549
01:04:09.610 --&gt; 01:04:21.949
sarahkayongo: I&#39;m just on the road

550
01:04:22.400 --&gt; 01:04:24.680
I&#39;m just leaving, and never now.

551
01:04:25.130 --&gt; 01:04:26.440
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh.

552
01:04:26.920 --&gt; 01:04:33.060
sarahkayongo: are you supposed to be talking while driving will distract you.

553
01:04:34.150 --&gt; 01:04:36.709
Martin Muwaga: You refer to women are the only people who cannot

554
01:04:58.880 --&gt; 01:05:00.320
Abimereki Muzaale: of a

555
01:05:00.550 --&gt; 01:05:03.750
Abimereki Muzaale: the previous

556
01:05:03.930 --&gt; 01:05:05.360
sarahkayongo: oh, you guys.

557
01:05:06.380 --&gt; 01:05:14.149
sarahkayongo: I need to be. Oh, my gosh, no, my phone was my laptop was on 86. Now, it&#39;s on 6.

558
01:05:14.350 --&gt; 01:05:17.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s an old, that&#39;s an old laptop.

559
01:05:17.370 --&gt; 01:05:21.300
sarahkayongo: Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s really it&#39;s really old. Now I just

560
01:05:21.450 --&gt; 01:05:26.319
sarahkayongo: use it for things like this. David. Yeah.

561
01:05:26.390 --&gt; 01:05:28.950
okay, I guess you can begin

562
01:05:29.720 --&gt; 01:05:31.630
Patrick: alright.

563
01:05:32.390 --&gt; 01:05:40.110
Patrick: May have already shared with you my prayer request. I need to get out of that zone of anxiety and confusion, and

564
01:05:40.170 --&gt; 01:05:47.299
Patrick: I&#39;m really at the the end towards the end of these things. But ending is so hard

565
01:05:48.830 --&gt; 01:05:52.969
Patrick: ending is not as easy as as when you&#39;re in the middle.

566
01:05:53.590 --&gt; 01:05:57.900
Patrick: It&#39;s just like taking off in the plane flying and then landing

567
01:05:58.110 --&gt; 01:06:00.200
the landing part. My friend

568
01:06:00.890 --&gt; 01:06:02.880
Patrick: wears a lot of skill.

569
01:06:03.320 --&gt; 01:06:16.619
Abimereki Muzaale: Need to clean up so much. Have your facts right up, all your details aligned with what must be done. Okay, this this time I&#39;m going share. I&#39;ll share the screen as I scribe so that you can. You can mention anything I&#39;m missing.

570
01:06:16.790 --&gt; 01:06:19.170
Abimereki Muzaale: So here.

571
01:06:20.770 --&gt; 01:06:23.370
sarahkayongo: what? What is what

572
01:06:24.890 --&gt; 01:06:34.440
sarahkayongo: zone is it? Was it the green z10, me!

573
01:06:34.910 --&gt; 01:06:37.210
sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know

574
01:06:37.260 --&gt; 01:06:42.629
Patrick: which which bring zone. Are you talking about today? So the issue is, you need motivation to.

575
01:06:45.890 --&gt; 01:06:53.529
Patrick: I think I think I just need to start working. I need to start walking because I feel a bit daunted.

576
01:06:54.150 --&gt; 01:07:06.960
Patrick: I feel quite daunted. Then, on top of that I am I am praying for, for we continue to believe God to fix my salary. I told you what happened? Did I? Did I share? Yes.

577
01:07:07.960 --&gt; 01:07:11.370
Patrick: yes, I need that salary to be sorted out

578
01:07:12.100 --&gt; 01:07:17.169
Patrick:  God has seen us through the holiday amazingly. I&#39;m very thankful

579
01:07:17.390 --&gt; 01:07:21.149
cause. Money has been coming in from different sources.

580
01:07:21.420 --&gt; 01:07:28.410
Patrick: and that really shows how how great God is, because God doesn&#39;t depend on the salary to bless you.

581
01:07:28.900 --&gt; 01:07:36.969
Patrick: Yes, I had Martin&#39;s birthday. Jay came in in a most miraculous way, and jam really so grateful. He came in and

582
01:07:36.980 --&gt; 01:07:43.089
Patrick: said, No, this thing can&#39;t flop, because some guys are just taking their time to fix your salary.

583
01:07:43.710 --&gt; 01:07:45.649
Patrick: And the thing was sorted

584
01:07:45.760 --&gt; 01:07:50.050
completely, and the young man had the perfect birthday celebration.

585
01:07:50.720 --&gt; 01:07:53.830
Patrick: So God has been providing. And

586
01:07:54.290 --&gt; 01:07:56.849
and I am very, very thankful

587
01:07:57.400 --&gt; 01:08:04.699
Patrick: we have gone through these weeks. We have not lacked at all. not locked at all.

588
01:08:05.910 --&gt; 01:08:10.369
Patrick: But you know how the devil whispers, do you want in a way that says, Hey, you man.

589
01:08:10.870 --&gt; 01:08:15.029
Patrick: they are doing badly. Yeah. But I refuse to.

590
01:08:15.050 --&gt; 01:08:22.070
to, to to be there listening to him. So I really pray that I can finish this study.

591
01:08:22.340 --&gt; 01:08:26.050
Patrick: I want to get it out of the way, because so much is not happening.

592
01:08:26.290 --&gt; 01:08:31.789
Patrick: So much is not happening because of of the anxiety of trying to finish.

593
01:08:31.930 --&gt; 01:08:33.819
Patrick: It&#39;s a very daunting

594
01:08:33.970 --&gt; 01:08:37.630
experience and state and position I&#39;m in right now.

595
01:08:37.950 --&gt; 01:08:43.379
Patrick: When I just think of all that I need to do, I feel paralyzed, as Sarah put it.

596
01:08:43.850 --&gt; 01:08:46.189
I feel like I can&#39;t move a muscle

597
01:08:46.760 --&gt; 01:08:52.310
Patrick: then of I also thank God so much. D, you know what? Remember when we talked about the blood clot?

598
01:08:52.340 --&gt; 01:09:00.640
Patrick: Yes, yes, yes, and and we we laughed it off, and I said, I&#39;m not gonna see the doctor. Guess what they came for me.

599
01:09:01.560 --&gt; 01:09:03.849
Patrick: Dr. Dr. Mugasha, your friend.

600
01:09:04.510 --&gt; 01:09:09.039
Patrick: She she she seized being my friend at that time.

601
01:09:09.120 --&gt; 01:09:18.629
Patrick: she insisted the specialist was called in, but so I said, You know what, for the sake of peace let me go, and indeed there&#39;s completely nothing.

602
01:09:19.600 --&gt; 01:09:23.129
Patrick: So I have peace with her. I have peace with this specialist.

603
01:09:23.529 --&gt; 01:09:45.109
Abimereki Muzaale: and they checked, and all they found was my muscles had been hot. They&#39;ve been damaged. That&#39;s what I told you. Yeah, I told you professional. After every workout they use ice. They they they protect their bodies from inflammation. The injury that comes from the workout.

604
01:09:45.290 --&gt; 01:09:47.300
Patrick: Exactly. Exactly.

605
01:09:48.120 --&gt; 01:09:51.179
Patrick: Yeah. So I have. I&#39;m now in physiotherapy.

606
01:09:51.520 --&gt; 01:09:53.079
Patrick: and I&#39;m getting better.

607
01:09:53.100 --&gt; 01:09:55.430
The muscles that become like a rock.

608
01:09:55.550 --&gt; 01:09:58.249
Patrick: that they&#39;re pulling themselves too hard.

609
01:09:58.860 --&gt; 01:10:06.229
Patrick: So he&#39;s doing things using a certain red light, using electricity, using so many interesting things.

610
01:10:06.240 --&gt; 01:10:08.500
I did enjoy the electric shocks.

611
01:10:08.560 --&gt; 01:10:12.530
Patrick: But think that stage is over stimulation.

612
01:10:13.430 --&gt; 01:10:17.459
Yeah, it was nasty, but the the muscles have now relaxed

613
01:10:28.070 --&gt; 01:10:32.150
these muscles at the back of your knee. They&#39;re called calf muscles.

614
01:10:32.220 --&gt; 01:10:38.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, the the cuffs, yes, below, below the back and below.

615
01:10:38.440 --&gt; 01:10:45.770
Abimereki Muzaale: and then the sheen, and then on the site. Yes.

616
01:10:45.990 --&gt; 01:10:50.500
Patrick: so so. So! When I was explaining what I had gone through after that exercise.

617
01:10:50.520 --&gt; 01:10:52.499
she was laughing and relaxed

618
01:10:52.570 --&gt; 01:10:58.160
Patrick: until I mentioned pain in the cuff muscles. She turned into another person.

619
01:10:58.190 --&gt; 01:11:01.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Because going because because we have prices

620
01:11:01.730 --&gt; 01:11:07.129
Abimereki Muzaale: that so so so this that&#39;s just a red flag for very fear of vascular disease.

621
01:11:07.210 --&gt; 01:11:33.229
Abimereki Muzaale: But for me, as I was telling you, you did not take the boxes, for this is the cause of injury to me is so obvious. It&#39;s exercise which even Olympians prevent through ice immersion in my in ice tabs of exercise. So how how appropriate! But but with more information, it was not necessary as you guys. Yeah.

622
01:11:34.050 --&gt; 01:11:34.890
sarahkayongo: Hello.

623
01:11:35.190 --&gt; 01:11:45.189
Patrick: yeah. But I know know how I&#39;m going to be doing exercise. I&#39;ll I&#39;ll be gentle at the beginning. I&#39;ll not just jump into a very, very highly intense

624
01:11:45.670 --&gt; 01:11:50.520
sarahkayongo: exercise. So you have to stretch also before you. Yes.

625
01:11:50.860 --&gt; 01:11:52.100
Patrick: exactly.

626
01:11:52.580 --&gt; 01:12:01.960
Patrick: Yeah. Yeah. So I&#39;m thankful to God. Dorothy is in Kampala. Yesterday she got a memo, saying all stuff were on contract.

627
01:12:02.140 --&gt; 01:12:04.710
to be confirmed!

628
01:12:05.470 --&gt; 01:12:10.190
Patrick: So Dorothy is going to get a letter soon, confirming her as

629
01:12:10.400 --&gt; 01:12:14.850
a full time member of staff of the central Bank of the Republic of Uganda.

630
01:12:14.990 --&gt; 01:12:25.490
Patrick: So for me, that is a very beautiful, powerful answer the prayer. We&#39;ve been praying about this, you know. Yeah.

631
01:12:25.780 --&gt; 01:12:30.629
Patrick: And now, you see, when your full time staff, you have cloud, you can talk. You can say.

632
01:12:30.640 --&gt; 01:12:35.189
Patrick: this is what I want. This. I don&#39;t want this. You you you talk with more authority.

633
01:12:35.580 --&gt; 01:12:38.439
Patrick: Someone doesn&#39;t keep you around. But

634
01:12:38.600 --&gt; 01:12:42.010
Abimereki Muzaale: look at the AI auto completion. Do you see that?

635
01:12:42.600 --&gt; 01:13:08.269
Patrick:  I say good is good. Oh, my God! And we paid for Lisa.

636
01:13:08.600 --&gt; 01:13:12.269
Patrick: Now we we are main with fees for Martin. And

637
01:13:12.340 --&gt; 01:13:13.699
Patrick: when you recall

638
01:13:15.010 --&gt; 01:13:21.410
Patrick: Nicole, Nicole didn&#39;t do well, she&#39;s very. She&#39;s not interested, that&#39;s my biggest

639
01:13:21.550 --&gt; 01:13:26.159
Patrick: motivation. She&#39;s she&#39;s very switched off. She

640
01:13:26.850 --&gt; 01:13:33.349
Patrick: but if you say? Let us go out. dress up, we&#39;re going out. My God! Do you think this is another person?

641
01:13:33.370 --&gt; 01:13:51.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Basically, what you&#39;ve described is literally a a graph of green zones, and whatever she is not being challenged, whatever whatever is doing is not more is not, is not motivating her at all.

642
01:13:51.500 --&gt; 01:14:08.269
Patrick: It&#39;s not motivating her at all. Yes, so we are now trying to think we need. We will just ask God to lead us what what would really challenge Nicole and make her enjoy her challenge. And yet it translated to income as well.

643
01:14:09.280 --&gt; 01:14:10.950
That&#39;s what we are praying for.

644
01:14:11.060 --&gt; 01:14:16.640
Patrick: cause. This thing of going to school going to class is not her thing at all.

645
01:14:16.770 --&gt; 01:14:18.399
Patrick: Yeah, just not happy.

646
01:14:18.780 --&gt; 01:14:24.649
Patrick: And the teachers have tried for the last 4 years I saw the most dedicated teacher

647
01:14:24.950 --&gt; 01:14:29.959
Patrick: reaching a point of feeling very, very frustrated cause. Nicole can show it to you that

648
01:14:30.370 --&gt; 01:14:32.169
Patrick: you know you&#39;re pushing. But

649
01:14:32.670 --&gt; 01:14:34.899
she she just shows it to that, you know.

650
01:14:35.950 --&gt; 01:14:38.780
Patrick: try all you want. But I think I&#39;m not interested.

651
01:14:39.180 --&gt; 01:14:41.469
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s so so easy.

652
01:14:41.500 --&gt; 01:14:49.650
Abimereki Muzaale: This is very important topic. Because, the question is engagement, you know. Yeah. And she&#39;s not engaged clearly.

653
01:14:49.690 --&gt; 01:14:51.609
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, definitely, she&#39;s in

654
01:14:51.690 --&gt; 01:15:17.439
Patrick: something she likes. She really pushes the bridge. If you say we are going to Dubai tomorrow, and now your room must be. You must have swept. Go and make sure the car is washed. Go and do shopping. Go and do this. My God, she will do everything to that, dot. This is very important diagnosis. She&#39;s not engaged.

655
01:15:18.220 --&gt; 01:15:31.989
sarahkayongo: and also the incentive, the incentive. Well, I mean. So so that&#39;s the challenge of teachers. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what engagement is to give people motivation.

656
01:15:32.110 --&gt; 01:15:41.790
Patrick: Even if you said we are going to Mumbai, just invaded to go and have a weekend with the in-laws and be at the resort. Yeah. My friend.

657
01:15:42.570 --&gt; 01:15:44.669
she would have got

658
01:15:46.860 --&gt; 01:15:59.469
Abimereki Muzaale: so this is a challenge that&#39;s mostly directed towards instructors. Because that&#39;s a challenge thinking about this thing the whole since I think. June

659
01:15:59.480 --&gt; 01:16:02.700
Abimereki Muzaale: engaging. How do keep people engaged?

660
01:16:02.710 --&gt; 01:16:16.300
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I was thinking about it from reactions for my students, some who are bored, others were anxious. That&#39;s how I ended up with that graph because some people the challenges are giving them too much, others, they&#39;re too low.

661
01:16:16.340 --&gt; 01:16:23.759
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So the the board. So how do you step up for some students while stepping down for others.

662
01:16:23.770 --&gt; 01:16:32.009
Abimereki Muzaale: My solution. I actually, because I&#39;ve gotten the clarity of the question is to have 3 different classes beginners intermediate and advanced

663
01:16:32.190 --&gt; 01:16:40.990
Abimereki Muzaale: so so Nicole&#39;s issues high structures. Need need to realize that the problems that they&#39;re not engaging. Huh?

664
01:16:41.590 --&gt; 01:16:43.650
Patrick: Yeah, true. Yeah.

665
01:16:43.970 --&gt; 01:16:49.210
Abimereki Muzaale: That is the big. Yeah. Okay? So that&#39;s I&#39;ve noted that.

666
01:16:50.060 --&gt; 01:16:50.850
Hmm.

667
01:16:51.310 --&gt; 01:17:08.429
sarahkayongo: that&#39;s interesting. Because I had a boss, a Vp. Who asked without really fully engaged or being under utilized. That&#39;s a very important question and very focused also, yeah.

668
01:17:08.480 --&gt; 01:17:29.449
sarahkayongo: Yeah. And I told him I was being under utilized. And by the end of the week he was thinking of some projects to put me on like, there&#39;s been a story of my life for the last, maybe 15 years, and the solution, of course, one solution would have been me to leave

669
01:17:29.490 --&gt; 01:17:50.040
sarahkayongo: but other solution I worked so far. My mentor left. I got disrupted. Now I have to, you know. Have step up I got challenge.

670
01:17:50.040 --&gt; 01:18:03.190
Abimereki Muzaale: I move from the green pastures into the fire. Now my situation is similar to yours felt under utilized, but

671
01:18:03.200 --&gt; 01:18:10.800
Patrick: I know that if anything happened and I&#39;m suddenly needed for thorough utilization, I need to also be through this study.

672
01:18:11.170 --&gt; 01:18:13.429
Patrick: You need to avoid me. I miss that bit.

673
01:18:14.520 --&gt; 01:18:18.010
Patrick: I was saying, I felt the way you did

674
01:18:18.240 --&gt; 01:18:27.380
Patrick: about being underutilized, and my prayer is to be utilized more. But again I my prayer is that I be utilized after I am through my studies.

675
01:18:27.500 --&gt; 01:18:40.290
Patrick: cause once I&#39;m engaged at that level. Now, then, it will jeopardize by completion of these studies. Yet I have very just a few things to do. I&#39;m gonna put my papers together and submit them for for publication.

676
01:18:40.550 --&gt; 01:18:47.399
Patrick: Well, very interesting. The language of use.

677
01:18:47.440 --&gt; 01:18:49.569
Abimereki Muzaale: This is your language, Luke. Yeah.

678
01:18:50.040 --&gt; 01:18:55.020
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yeah, those graphs the language of use is essentially

679
01:18:56.160 --&gt; 01:18:57.740
sarahkayongo: I&#39;m confused.

680
01:18:57.910 --&gt; 01:19:04.520
sarahkayongo: So you want to pray for the green zone to

681
01:19:04.620 --&gt; 01:19:25.780
Abimereki Muzaale: what you mean by after it means father down the ski line? That&#39;s what you&#39;re saying, because let&#39;s say right now you to put in the Red Zone. But if the ski line is pushed. Yeah, yeah, yellow. Does that make sense?

682
01:19:25.920 --&gt; 01:19:31.309
Patrick: If? If? Yeah, it does. But you see, the moment I am given work at office.

683
01:19:31.420 --&gt; 01:19:33.719
Patrick: Then I won&#39;t be able to do that. Ph, d.

684
01:19:33.810 --&gt; 01:19:42.519
sarahkayongo: Because because you don&#39;t build skills with work you&#39;re doing. Routine

685
01:19:42.940 --&gt; 01:20:06.480
Abimereki Muzaale: routine does not allow for growth. That&#39;s a green zone doesn&#39;t need to grow. Growth only comes from the yellow zone. Because you&#39;re going to higher challenges, higher challenges, higher skill. The growth of skills is the growth. But the green zone. You&#39;re avoiding challenges. So you&#39;re just stuck with your skills.

686
01:20:06.570 --&gt; 01:20:15.269
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I&#39;m avoiding work challenges. But I&#39;m happy to get the school challenges. I&#39;ll take them on and I will do them.

687
01:20:15.280 --&gt; 01:20:26.759
Patrick: Once these guys start sending me up country giving me assignments that take weeks. That means I&#39;ve put the books aside and I won&#39;t be making progress. Meanwhile graduation day is coming.

688
01:20:26.780 --&gt; 01:20:28.519
Patrick: I want to be on the list.

689
01:20:28.890 --&gt; 01:20:39.270
Patrick: I need to be on that list. Yeah, yeah. So I need to really finish that Phd, and

690
01:20:39.580 --&gt; 01:20:41.229
get it out of the way.

691
01:20:42.940 --&gt; 01:20:43.710
Yeah.

692
01:20:45.890 --&gt; 01:20:49.149
Abimereki Muzaale: back at one, as they say back at one

693
01:20:50.120 --&gt; 01:20:54.199
Abimereki Muzaale: I need I need I need. And I need to get oh, look what it&#39;s saying.

694
01:20:55.080 --&gt; 01:21:00.280
Abimereki Muzaale: that&#39;s the AI, and we do. I need to do the work and get that. This is not too quick.

695
01:21:00.530 --&gt; 01:21:02.580
Abimereki Muzaale: This is a look at the air.

696
01:21:02.720 --&gt; 01:21:11.200
Patrick: Can you see how how is that? How is that possible? Because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a large language when you&#39;re speaking my microphone, or what?

697
01:21:11.260 --&gt; 01:21:16.029
Abimereki Muzaale: No, it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a token. So

698
01:21:16.170 --&gt; 01:21:27.509
Abimereki Muzaale: II figured out how AI works, and I checked even on Wikipedia. They&#39;re called tokens. So in in gospel. My go. I told you about my gospel music university that I&#39;m studying in

699
01:21:28.250 --&gt; 01:21:37.940
Abimereki Muzaale: to play, like a black goes for artists, pianist, so when when it goes for artists, he has a not a melody.

700
01:21:38.540 --&gt; 01:21:40.130
Abimereki Muzaale: the number of codes.

701
01:21:40.190 --&gt; 01:21:44.440
Abimereki Muzaale: hard probabilities that imagine his head is actually fixed.

702
01:21:45.430 --&gt; 01:21:49.339
Abimereki Muzaale: There&#39;s a list of codes that can go with that note.

703
01:21:49.600 --&gt; 01:21:54.959
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s good thinking that II did. I did not have until this class.

704
01:21:54.970 --&gt; 01:22:08.089
Abimereki Muzaale: Of course you know that. Yes, the same melody I&#39;d already been even working on a new Namia variations. Yeah. So yes, I already knew that I could produce different sort of chords for the same song. I knew that already.

705
01:22:08.200 --&gt; 01:22:12.579
Abimereki Muzaale: But in gospel music it&#39;s is a fixed number of courts

706
01:22:12.750 --&gt; 01:22:20.500
Abimereki Muzaale: like. With this note you can have only 7 optional cards for that one, only 2 for this one only 9.

707
01:22:20.750 --&gt; 01:22:24.470
Abimereki Muzaale: So that is also how these models work.

708
01:22:24.550 --&gt; 01:22:29.880
Abimereki Muzaale: When you&#39;ve written something like circus back at one, I need

709
01:22:30.000 --&gt; 01:22:33.170
Abimereki Muzaale: given all these things I&#39;ve written above. From one up to 10

710
01:22:33.570 --&gt; 01:22:35.429
Abimereki Muzaale: it uses information

711
01:22:35.970 --&gt; 01:22:43.939
Abimereki Muzaale: based on its this thing has been trained on 1.3 trillion parameters, 1.3 trillion. That&#39;s

712
01:22:44.030 --&gt; 01:22:48.709
Abimereki Muzaale: more than I don&#39;t know thousands of trillion data points

713
01:22:48.750 --&gt; 01:22:53.279
Abimereki Muzaale: and so it says, if you have written this 10 points already.

714
01:22:53.450 --&gt; 01:22:57.160
Abimereki Muzaale: and I says Sac was back at one. So it just went back to one here

715
01:22:57.420 --&gt; 01:23:01.790
Patrick: and extracted this. That&#39;s what I did.

716
01:23:01.920 --&gt; 01:23:04.710
Patrick: It expected that. Yeah.

717
01:23:05.020 --&gt; 01:23:06.760
Patrick: Okay.

718
01:23:06.940 --&gt; 01:23:14.980
Patrick: Imagine I did this for my masters, but I&#39;m now seeing it. Practically. I&#39;ve never done this practically to pass the paper.

719
01:23:15.090 --&gt; 01:23:16.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

720
01:23:16.650 --&gt; 01:23:22.440
Patrick: AI AI is robotics that uses an inference engine and uses

721
01:23:22.710 --&gt; 01:23:24.229
Patrick: a knowledge base.

722
01:23:24.490 --&gt; 01:23:34.949
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, this generates is based on heuristics. So that&#39;s what is calling tokens other than heuristics.

723
01:23:35.750 --&gt; 01:23:44.289
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s a structured language. So the structure of language in English is subject. Verb, object.

724
01:23:44.460 --&gt; 01:24:05.429
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. II run to the the grocery store. So I subject run is a verb. Object is the grocery store. All all languages like that, whether it&#39;s even computer cord. If you look at any of the codes, there&#39;s a subject verb object

725
01:24:05.800 --&gt; 01:24:11.329
and so models are able to use those heuristics. That&#39;s how AI is thriving.

726
01:24:11.690 --&gt; 01:24:22.039
Patrick: That&#39;s exactly what it does, exactly what it does. And at that time I didn&#39;t really understand. I just got the thing, and then just had to pass the exam.

727
01:24:22.130 --&gt; 01:24:26.119
Abimereki Muzaale: Hey? Now I&#39;ve seen the application

728
01:24:26.630 --&gt; 01:24:38.990
Patrick: alright. The I&#39;ve secured your those other things. So, Sarah, I think

729
01:24:39.340 --&gt; 01:24:43.570
sarahkayongo: that graphical illustration was so appropriate.

730
01:24:43.660 --&gt; 01:24:51.559
sarahkayongo: I was kind of in the boredom. It&#39;s so so easy for me to get in the boredom the green zone

731
01:24:52.070 --&gt; 01:25:03.259
sarahkayongo: cause. I challenge myself quickly. II get in a high. I finish up project, and then I&#39;m I&#39;m always, actually, always, you know, in the

732
01:25:03.640 --&gt; 01:25:07.719
sarahkayongo: finishing off, and then I hit the bottom. But this time

733
01:25:08.390 --&gt; 01:25:11.669
sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t know how it happened. A Vp

734
01:25:11.950 --&gt; 01:25:23.529
sarahkayongo: very senior person. You know I&#39;ve written, I think sometime last year I told you guys I&#39;d written a concept, not about process.

735
01:25:23.540 --&gt; 01:25:26.859
sarahkayongo: some improvements and so on.

736
01:25:27.030 --&gt; 01:25:30.989
sarahkayongo: and they never had from them. But then

737
01:25:31.130 --&gt; 01:25:38.630
sarahkayongo: we had a meeting we had. We had planned several meetings. We never had time until recently.

738
01:25:39.420 --&gt; 01:25:43.239
sarahkayongo: when the Vp. Was like. Well,

739
01:25:43.910 --&gt; 01:25:49.819
sarahkayongo: II think you&#39;re one of the people we who are under utilized and would like for you to

740
01:25:50.150 --&gt; 01:25:51.859
sarahkayongo: to just

741
01:25:52.070 --&gt; 01:25:59.410
sarahkayongo: be more agile, so that we can for you to be a part of other projects.

742
01:25:59.600 --&gt; 01:26:05.800
sarahkayongo: One of the things we offer our company offers is management, consultancy for

743
01:26:06.190 --&gt; 01:26:10.310
sarahkayongo: for governments. and so

744
01:26:10.610 --&gt; 01:26:19.589
sarahkayongo: there are opportunities coming up, and Dora is one of them to provide economic development work.

745
01:26:19.860 --&gt; 01:26:30.680
sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t know what that will look like, but it may involve some travel down the line and maybe extended. and I&#39;m open to that.

746
01:26:30.870 --&gt; 01:26:35.490
sarahkayongo: And then, of course, Ukraine, which seems to be a scramble.

747
01:26:35.650 --&gt; 01:26:38.510
sarahkayongo: These these are trillion dollars

748
01:26:38.920 --&gt; 01:26:45.190
sarahkayongo: that is being you know, the government of Ukraine has put out, and

749
01:26:45.530 --&gt; 01:26:49.899
sarahkayongo: and the West every power is really scrambling to really

750
01:26:50.310 --&gt; 01:26:59.090
sarahkayongo: find Ukraine&#39;s rehabilitation, post-war development. So I&#39;m a part of that. But that one I&#39;m not so

751
01:26:59.120 --&gt; 01:27:01.790
sarahkayongo: him because

752
01:27:02.590 --&gt; 01:27:10.429
sarahkayongo: it involves, you know. There, there are so many young people want to go to Ukraine and just put it on their.

753
01:27:10.480 --&gt; 01:27:18.289
sarahkayongo: We are contractors, just like Afghanistan people. There were more contractors in Afghanistan, by the way.

754
01:27:18.420 --&gt; 01:27:23.990
sarahkayongo: more than all the armies combined. There were more American contractors.

755
01:27:24.290 --&gt; 01:27:29.419
sarahkayongo: It&#39;s business, as usual. I don&#39;t want to be in Ukraine for any reason.

756
01:27:29.790 --&gt; 01:27:36.880
sarahkayongo: so I&#39;d rather take something like Doha so I&#39;m praying that

757
01:27:36.890 --&gt; 01:27:39.899
that materializes into something.

758
01:27:40.660 --&gt; 01:27:42.520
sarahkayongo: Otherwise my

759
01:27:43.250 --&gt; 01:27:50.450
sarahkayongo: my request is the same. For national independence, and more

760
01:27:50.570 --&gt; 01:27:57.649
sarahkayongo: the ability to come out of debt. I&#39;m actually beginning to intentionally come out of some debts.

761
01:27:58.210 --&gt; 01:28:02.440
sarahkayongo: And I I&#39;m positioning myself to.

762
01:28:03.120 --&gt; 01:28:05.649
sarahkayongo: Yeah. There are few dates of paid off.

763
01:28:06.190 --&gt; 01:28:16.459
sarahkayongo: and now I&#39;m ready even to be able to take care of my college student loan, which begins in October. So I pray to God for for vision, for that

764
01:28:17.240 --&gt; 01:28:19.299
sarahkayongo: and for the Ph. D.

765
01:28:20.090 --&gt; 01:28:28.649
sarahkayongo: The only college loan I have in life. All my education was sponsored, so I&#39;m grateful.

766
01:28:28.740 --&gt; 01:28:37.129
sarahkayongo: And and because and and it it has come at the right time. Because, you know, I finished in 2,020,

767
01:28:37.270 --&gt; 01:28:50.040
sarahkayongo: and this administration had just come into power, and one of the key hallmarks for their election was to reduce or cut student loans.

768
01:28:50.640 --&gt; 01:28:58.309
sarahkayongo: So the issue has been debated for 3 years the Republicans have been opposed to it. Yeah.

769
01:28:58.390 --&gt; 01:29:16.660
sarahkayongo: yeah, it has been so for 3 years. We&#39;ve not paid any student loans. We&#39;re just going to be very remarkable even now there&#39;s so many opportunities to to even

770
01:29:16.820 --&gt; 01:29:37.729
sarahkayongo: claim some some. So if you don&#39;t have a job, you almost don&#39;t have to pay right away, and if you want to start paying as little as you can. It&#39;s very negotiable, and it was never like that. So I&#39;m grateful for that, and I&#39;m going to apply for a lower repayment

771
01:29:38.730 --&gt; 01:29:45.819
sarahkayongo: monthly loan. It&#39;s a very important loan, and I look forward to paying it.

772
01:29:46.520 --&gt; 01:29:56.279
sarahkayongo: I pray for Lauren. You know she&#39;s doing better mentally. And I were discussing that.

773
01:29:56.680 --&gt; 01:29:57.830
sarahkayongo: And she&#39;s.

774
01:29:58.280 --&gt; 01:30:06.089
sarahkayongo: you know, it&#39;s a continued prayer for her to stay focused and really think about her future, because

775
01:30:06.160 --&gt; 01:30:09.299
sarahkayongo: sometimes we have great discussions.

776
01:30:09.850 --&gt; 01:30:17.890
sarahkayongo: She wants to do some courses, and II pray that she stayed that course. But mentally she&#39;s doing much better.

777
01:30:18.210 --&gt; 01:30:25.120
sarahkayongo: And, Kevin. I&#39;m grateful for him because he&#39;s well. I&#39;m grateful to God for what he.

778
01:30:25.600 --&gt; 01:30:27.159
sarahkayongo: Dan. It&#39;s alive.

779
01:30:27.450 --&gt; 01:30:39.000
sarahkayongo: because this morning he called me excited about news of the possibility. He has an opportunity to start his Master&#39;s degree

780
01:30:39.120 --&gt; 01:30:42.730

01:30:42.970 --&gt; 01:30:48.660
sarahkayongo: And he wants to to do. Actually, he met with the recruiters. He went for.

782
01:30:49.200 --&gt; 01:30:55.979
sarahkayongo: Yeah, he went. He went to recruiters. He has some African friends who have inspired him.

783
01:30:56.820 --&gt; 01:31:02.849
sarahkayongo: and so he wants to start as early as next year in January.

784
01:31:03.040 --&gt; 01:31:10.950
sarahkayongo: to do a masters in financial.

785
01:31:11.210 --&gt; 01:31:12.830
sarahkayongo: So I say.

786
01:31:13.040 --&gt; 01:31:28.029
sarahkayongo: and his job actually will pay for it. So I pray that he can be accepted, and that he gets into the program while his job can pay for his Master&#39;s degree. Yeah.

787
01:31:29.090 --&gt; 01:31:36.650
sarahkayongo: for I pray for good. So for health. I also have an injury. I injured my big foot.

788
01:31:36.970 --&gt; 01:31:43.509
sarahkayongo: Ii don&#39;t know this so much pain. I can&#39;t wear high heels.

789
01:31:45.150 --&gt; 01:31:48.289
sarahkayongo: I need to go see a doctor.

790
01:31:48.390 --&gt; 01:31:52.910
Patrick: Yeah, please do that quickly. And then, put all fears aside.

791
01:31:53.670 --&gt; 01:31:55.760
Patrick: You might need to do some physio

792
01:31:57.470 --&gt; 01:31:58.870
sarahkayongo: for my big foot.

793
01:32:00.120 --&gt; 01:32:13.369
Patrick: Yeah, it&#39;s I is it? Is it around? Oh, big toe. Okay?

sarahkayongo: And

799
01:32:39.390 --&gt; 01:32:40.940
sarahkayongo: that&#39;s all for me.

800
01:32:42.470 --&gt; 01:32:43.620
Patrick: Okay.

801
01:32:43.770 --&gt; 01:32:45.639
Abimereki Muzaale: Jay is Jay back?

802
01:32:46.370 --&gt; 01:32:49.179
sarahkayongo: Lost him? Oh.

803
01:32:49.510 --&gt; 01:32:56.759
Abimereki Muzaale: okay. So come move to me so. P. I will share. How? How do I share this?

804
01:32:57.700 --&gt; 01:33:00.620
sarahkayongo: Can I share where yours deep?

805
01:33:01.410 --&gt; 01:33:08.589
Abimereki Muzaale: I haven&#39;t written them yet. I just wanted to share my screen. How do II don&#39;t share my screen. Aren&#39;t you to see me?

806
01:33:08.910 --&gt; 01:33:10.179
Abimereki Muzaale: How do you do that?

807
01:33:11.330 --&gt; 01:33:18.099
sarahkayongo: Can you see me full?

808
01:33:18.420 --&gt; 01:33:19.570
sarahkayongo: We would.

809
01:33:19.590 --&gt; 01:33:24.979
sarahkayongo: Oh, always because I can&#39;t see you. I didn&#39;t realize you could see me.

810
01:33:25.960 --&gt; 01:33:30.870
sarahkayongo: No, me. I think I was on and off the video. But and he&#39;s also back.

811
01:33:31.130 --&gt; 01:33:48.999
sarahkayongo: Well, because you&#39;re sharing your screen and we can. But I&#39;m not sharing. Oh, oh, I&#39;m sharing screen. I don&#39;t share my screen. So I accidentally right into this, and I don&#39;t know how.

812
01:33:49.450 --&gt; 01:33:50.700
Abimereki Muzaale: But

813
01:33:50.750 --&gt; 01:33:55.320
Abimereki Muzaale: is that? 88 keyboard, 88 notice

814
01:33:55.560 --&gt; 01:33:58.570
Abimereki Muzaale: holdable. I saw it, and I was like, what

815
01:33:58.960 --&gt; 01:34:05.729
Abimereki Muzaale: and it does $75. That was even more shocking. I was like 77 77 was like.

816
01:34:05.930 --&gt; 01:34:09.980
Abimereki Muzaale: this is, I can afford to take a risk with $75.

817
01:34:10.060 --&gt; 01:34:11.080
sarahkayongo: It&#39;s

818
01:34:11.130 --&gt; 01:34:15.040
Abimereki Muzaale: that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m going to demonstrate.

819
01:34:15.280 --&gt; 01:34:20.889
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, huh! Oh, no, I should have

820
01:34:20.920 --&gt; 01:34:23.099
Abimereki Muzaale: I assumed it still had the charge.

821
01:34:23.310 --&gt; 01:34:30.709
Abimereki Muzaale: But just give me a second. Maybe I can plug this in

822
01:34:31.150 --&gt; 01:34:32.629
Abimereki Muzaale: and demonstrate.

823
01:34:32.840 --&gt; 01:34:40.600
Abimereki Muzaale: But for me I couldn&#39;t I could not II the concept because III envy, you know, guitarists who.

824
01:34:40.800 --&gt; 01:34:46.720
Abimereki Muzaale: if I just move around the instrument? Yeah, they just move around that instrument anywhere. I&#39;m like.

825
01:34:47.020 --&gt; 01:34:50.050
Abimereki Muzaale: you can&#39;t do that to the keyboard. You can&#39;t do that to the piano.

826
01:34:50.060 --&gt; 01:34:53.369
Abimereki Muzaale: So this for me is the closest

827
01:34:53.420 --&gt; 01:34:56.670
Abimereki Muzaale: to being like a guitarist catching up with Guitarist

828
01:34:57.040 --&gt; 01:35:02.369
Abimereki Muzaale: any. Maybe I&#39;ll demonstrate some other time. Let me. Oh, okay, I&#39;ll plug the

829
01:35:03.110 --&gt; 01:35:04.560
Abimereki Muzaale: plug the 10.

830
01:35:04.680 --&gt; 01:35:07.710
Abimereki Muzaale: Let me see, there&#39;s a USB,

831
01:35:07.830 --&gt; 01:35:09.590
Abimereki Muzaale: so okay.

832
01:35:09.970 --&gt; 01:35:19.490
Abimereki Muzaale: I mean

833
01:35:19.710 --&gt; 01:35:22.120
Abimereki Muzaale: none of that. And also that has me.

834
01:35:22.420 --&gt; 01:35:25.190
Patrick: So amazing.

835
01:35:25.280 --&gt; 01:35:26.670
Abimereki Muzaale: 75.

836
01:35:27.240 --&gt; 01:35:30.309
Patrick: Okay? But it&#39;s 88 notes. And so the

837
01:35:30.420 --&gt; 01:35:32.109
Abimereki Muzaale: standard size.

838
01:35:33.930 --&gt; 01:35:35.350
Patrick: Okay.

839
01:35:36.690 --&gt; 01:35:38.330
Abimereki Muzaale: There it is. It&#39;s on.

840
01:35:39.000 --&gt; 01:35:40.270
sarahkayongo: Wow!

841
01:35:40.590 --&gt; 01:35:42.299
Abimereki Muzaale: And I need volume

842
01:35:42.720 --&gt; 01:35:46.190
Abimereki Muzaale: is that I want to thank God

843
01:35:46.940 --&gt; 01:35:55.660
Abimereki Muzaale: for the S simple things. So so II need to change zoom to original sign for musicians off.

844
01:35:55.670 --&gt; 01:35:58.840
Abimereki Muzaale: Hope that&#39;s going to. And then this, sir.

845
01:35:59.220 --&gt; 01:36:02.160
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so I cannot do something like.

846
01:36:03.260 --&gt; 01:36:05.169
sarahkayongo: Oh, it is.

847
01:36:06.010 --&gt; 01:36:08.370
sarahkayongo: I can see

848
01:36:08.630 --&gt; 01:36:15.210
Abimereki Muzaale: I need like I didn&#39;t bring a lamp here so I can&#39;t see. I think I I&#39;m in a wrong voice. Oh, there it is.

849
01:36:19.180 --&gt; 01:36:28.580
Dx. 7. Yeah.

850
01:36:29.250 --&gt; 01:36:31.769
Patrick: that&#39;s me, I mean, thank you budget.

851
01:36:39.440 --&gt; 01:36:41.560
sarahkayongo: That&#39;s amazing.

852
01:36:42.750 --&gt; 01:36:52.999
Patrick: Yeah. So that so this is a for me, this encapsulates affordable 88 keys full

853
01:36:53.570 --&gt; 01:36:59.249
for keyboard. Right there, I forgot. Switch off.

854
01:36:59.720 --&gt; 01:37:03.139
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, but that fits

855
01:37:03.240 --&gt; 01:37:06.550
that fits. I think I forgot to switch this off

856
01:37:07.090 --&gt; 01:37:12.770
Abimereki Muzaale: that fits yeah, that fits in the bag here.

857
01:37:13.280 --&gt; 01:37:15.480
Abimereki Muzaale: So the guitarists are in trouble.

858
01:37:22.340 --&gt; 01:37:31.139
Abimereki Muzaale: So anyway, I think that for the simple things, the simple things for the simple things

859
01:37:31.380 --&gt; 01:37:38.689
Patrick: yes, yes, cause now that one I can travel with Uganda, and even live in Uganda.

860
01:37:38.870 --&gt; 01:37:57.270
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s not perfect. But it&#39;s an innovation which was exciting.

861
01:37:57.500 --&gt; 01:38:08.250
sarahkayongo: And she was telling me that how you guys to manage the chairs and whatever.

862
01:38:08.580 --&gt; 01:38:12.479
Abimereki Muzaale: So there is an innovation.

863
01:38:13.230 --&gt; 01:38:15.679
Patrick: Yeah, so

864
01:38:21.800 --&gt; 01:38:33.890
Abimereki Muzaale: oh, this is, yeah, it&#39;s a bit delicate as long as someone, it&#39;s not delicate. Actually, it&#39;s just The feel is a bit different because the keys are not deep.

865
01:38:34.660 --&gt; 01:38:42.500
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, cause they&#39;re very. They&#39;re the correct size, but they&#39;re flat. So it takes a bit getting used to

866
01:38:43.690 --&gt; 01:38:59.379
Abimereki Muzaale: but it has, it has over 100 voices over 100 bits over 50 demos, I mean, it&#39;s for for the, for its cost and convenience. It&#39;s really, really, really special. Yeah.

867
01:38:59.610 --&gt; 01:39:17.269
Abimereki Muzaale: So so yes, I&#39;m thankful to go for this small things in life. Ai is saying for the ability to work. That&#39;s more proper. If I if I was 80 years old, so just say for the foldable.

868
01:39:17.660 --&gt; 01:39:22.959
Abimereki Muzaale: 88. No, look at that completion. Keep you piano

872
01:39:50.900 --&gt; 01:39:56.729
Abimereki Muzaale: definitely zoom not some. Then Github.

881
01:40:27.510 --&gt; 01:40:33.090
Abimereki Muzaale: for for for the foldable piano may allow me.

882
01:40:33.850 --&gt; 01:40:35.629
Abimereki Muzaale: may facilitate

883
01:40:37.970 --&gt; 01:40:45.069
Abimereki Muzaale: praise and worship. and more remote suns. So this is

884

Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;ve been. I&#39;ve always been thankful for God blessing with health and all that I&#39;ve gained to today. I clocked in to 30 pounds. So I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever recorded a higher weight than that in my life.

Abimereki Muzaale:  for me

899
01:42:02.110 --&gt; 01:42:03.530
Abimereki Muzaale: regarding

900
01:42:05.590 --&gt; 01:42:09.579
Abimereki Muzaale: use of AI and introduction

901
01:42:09.830 --&gt; 01:42:10.969
Abimereki Muzaale: to

902
01:42:11.590 --&gt; 01:42:15.930
Abimereki Muzaale: should I call it? It? Yeah.

903
01:42:16.060 --&gt; 01:42:18.070
introduction to it

904
01:42:18.270 --&gt; 01:42:21.690
Abimereki Muzaale: and building platforms

905
01:42:22.810 --&gt; 01:42:25.499
Abimereki Muzaale: for work and collaboration?

906
01:42:26.060 --&gt; 01:42:32.339
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so that I think is my my biggest thing this year what&#39;s taking my time

907
01:42:32.480 --&gt; 01:42:43.769
Abimereki Muzaale: and what has occupied me fully. And it&#39;s also the reason I&#39;ve not been exercising, because I&#39;ve been completely absorbed by this. And I&#39;m extremely grateful for this.

908
01:42:43.940 --&gt; 01:42:46.579
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m really thankful. And

909
01:42:46.970 --&gt; 01:42:51.410
Abimereki Muzaale: II couldn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t. Yeah, I couldn&#39;t say this enough.

910
01:42:51.770 --&gt; 01:42:57.519
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so so that. That&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s it also thankful for.

911
01:42:58.810 --&gt; 01:43:05.379
Abimereki Muzaale:  I&#39;ve said this before, but I will say it again for completion.

912
01:43:06.060 --&gt; 01:43:12.959
Abimereki Muzaale: All ph d requirements except this is. Oh, look at it completing

913
01:43:13.110 --&gt; 01:43:14.710
Abimereki Muzaale: except this is

914
01:43:15.100 --&gt; 01:43:31.699
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m really, really, really, really can&#39;t say that again. It&#39;s been challenging. Yeah, passing classes, you know in the old days my prayers would will, after being a zone of getting as

915
01:43:31.800 --&gt; 01:43:35.589
Abimereki Muzaale: but I&#39;ve been humbled, and my goals have been to pass.

916
01:43:35.750 --&gt; 01:43:39.560
Abimereki Muzaale: and I&#39;m not trying to say that. But yes.

917
01:43:39.830 --&gt; 01:43:42.240
Abimereki Muzaale: this have been my goals, and

918
01:43:42.420 --&gt; 01:43:48.699
Abimereki Muzaale: the school because of the pandemic allowed

919
01:43:48.910 --&gt; 01:43:51.870
Abimereki Muzaale: even required courses to be done for pass fail

920
01:43:53.270 --&gt; 01:43:55.890
Abimereki Muzaale: from 2020 this year, they ended.

921
01:43:56.600 --&gt; 01:44:03.030
Abimereki Muzaale: they announced, because the Academic has started last week. They said. They&#39;re ending. The past failed. Staff returning to letter grades.

922
01:44:03.290 --&gt; 01:44:09.690
sarahkayongo: So I&#39;ve I&#39;ve dodged that phase. So my entire Phd, I&#39;ve been able to do things past fail.

923
01:44:10.080 --&gt; 01:44:21.609
Abimereki Muzaale: and it was very challenging. My goals were to pass my exam. The the classes where, I can tell you it was definitely many of the statistics classes were too advanced.

924
01:44:21.860 --&gt; 01:44:27.879
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, and my goal was like, if I need to pass. And I passed.

925
01:44:28.220 --&gt; 01:44:32.110
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, the data science class was a little too much.

926
01:44:32.170 --&gt; 01:44:43.750
Abimereki Muzaale: My goal again was to pass. II don&#39;t remember praying for an a ever. It has to pass. Yeah. So so for completion of all my requirements.

927
01:44:43.790 --&gt; 01:44:47.190
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s really, really, really a big deal. Yeah.

928
01:44:47.230 --&gt; 01:44:50.820
Abimereki Muzaale: And now my request?

929
01:44:51.980 --&gt; 01:44:58.459
Abimereki Muzaale:  So the first request is that, oh, motivation to do the work.

930
01:44:58.590 --&gt; 01:45:14.280
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, I will take but this audit has got wrong for the fees for the children so this one get back to physical

931
01:45:14.770 --&gt; 01:45:26.690
Abimereki Muzaale: activity. Oh. yes, get back to physics to exercise. There&#39;s another one I have. So hip left. Hip injury.

932
01:45:28.360 --&gt; 01:45:29.390
Abimereki Muzaale: and

933
01:45:30.460 --&gt; 01:45:33.900
Abimereki Muzaale: and say so. Swimmers sinusitis.

934
01:45:34.670 --&gt; 01:45:38.429
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;ve inflamed. I&#39;ve I&#39;ve inflamed my sinuses.

935
01:45:40.630 --&gt; 01:45:51.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, at first I thought, was Alaji chief, but there&#39;s no way I could have had allergies all this month. Haven&#39;t swam since May, so I have no reason to have it congested. Noz

936
01:45:52.410 --&gt; 01:45:56.579
Abimereki Muzaale: so I could also be. Rewriting

937
01:45:56.870 --&gt; 01:45:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: could be what

938
01:45:58.330 --&gt; 01:46:02.340
Patrick: Rhinite is a symptom. Rhinite is a symptom of

939
01:46:02.410 --&gt; 01:46:15.209
Abimereki Muzaale: sinusitis, or so Senegal or something. So it&#39;s just a symptom. But sinusitis is A a broader is actually an actual diagnosis. No, no, it&#39;s inflammation of the sinuses.

940
01:46:15.260 --&gt; 01:46:19.559
Abimereki Muzaale: Right? Right is the inflammation of the the Noz

941
01:46:19.630 --&gt; 01:46:30.010
Abimereki Muzaale: but the sinuses. And those are in related areas. So yeah, they&#39;re related. But the length of time I&#39;ve had to congested knows is too long for any of these other things.

942
01:46:30.080 --&gt; 01:46:34.639
Abimereki Muzaale: And when I connected the dots and the fact that I&#39;ve not swam since May.

943
01:46:35.480 --&gt; 01:46:41.770
Abimereki Muzaale: The injury was done from swimming. I&#39;ve done nothing but swim since

944
01:46:41.780 --&gt; 01:46:43.070
April last year.

945
01:46:43.620 --&gt; 01:46:49.349
Abimereki Muzaale: swimming 2 h every day. Don&#39;t think there&#39;s many human beings that swim that much

946
01:46:49.610 --&gt; 01:46:51.159
Abimereki Muzaale: in chorinated water.

947
01:46:51.620 --&gt; 01:46:56.580
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. And the chlorine is very rough on the on. The sinus is very rough.

948
01:46:56.900 --&gt; 01:47:07.200
Abimereki Muzaale: So II. So this diagnosis only came up with it, maybe yesterday. and it is 2 days ago, and it is revolutionary, because now I&#39;ve started treatment

949
01:47:08.870 --&gt; 01:47:21.600
Abimereki Muzaale: and I can already feel I can smell better. I could. I couldn&#39;t smell anything. I was not struggling, smelling anything. I can. I breathe better? Yeah, but I will have to continue the treatment.

950
01:47:21.920 --&gt; 01:47:30.870
Abimereki Muzaale:  for for the foreseeable future. So yes, so I pray, for you know, continued healing of my left injury, so that I can return to jogging.

951
01:47:31.020 --&gt; 01:47:39.780
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m thankful for the Dagnits of similar sinusitis, because that has led to directed treatment. I&#39;ve been going to a doctor, I&#39;m treating myself

952
01:47:40.090 --&gt; 01:47:42.610
so. I&#39;m ent specialist.

953
01:47:42.630 --&gt; 01:47:49.989
Abimereki Muzaale: If if I&#39;m not clear cured, then I will see a specialist. But for now the rate of improvement suggests that I&#39;ll be fine

954
01:47:50.420 --&gt; 01:47:58.830
Abimereki Muzaale: so yes, so so those are those things, then, for growth.

955
01:48:01.100 --&gt; 01:48:04.750
Abimereki Muzaale: an expansion of my.

956
01:48:04.970 --&gt; 01:48:16.380
Abimereki Muzaale: this one. I not get any chance to share my fenna platform.  I oh, you can see my screen. So yeah, yeah.

957
01:48:16.600 --&gt; 01:48:21.049
Abimereki Muzaale: have I shared? Have I ever shared about this platform? I don&#39;t think I have.

958
01:48:21.150 --&gt; 01:48:27.179
Abimereki Muzaale: So there&#39;s this one shared. I probably shared with you. So there&#39;s this platform

959
01:48:27.360 --&gt; 01:48:37.559
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;ve developed from the summer. It&#39;s called. But I&#39;m treating it as Uganda. Yeah.

960
01:48:37.590 --&gt; 01:48:47.930
Abimereki Muzaale: this is in in Chinese this, says Mandarin, my trainees, Vincent Jin gave me this. This is this is a means we&#39;re all in the same boat.

961
01:48:48.210 --&gt; 01:48:58.500
Abimereki Muzaale: This is a collaborator in California, in Arabic. Translated this, this is one of my trainees it&#39;s called Andrew. Arcing is Jewish.

962
01:48:59.170 --&gt; 01:49:01.079
That&#39;s his name under arcing

963
01:49:02.090 --&gt; 01:49:07.389
he gave me this. He gave me something idiomatic, asked him to give me something idiomatic in Hebrew

964
01:49:07.620 --&gt; 01:49:16.440
Abimereki Muzaale: that encapsulates this. So this is I discussed with Sarah. It&#39;s a long story which I won&#39;t get into, but I mentioned

965
01:49:16.470 --&gt; 01:49:21.669
Abimereki Muzaale: I got cancelled by my students if you know what we cancelled.

966
01:49:21.880 --&gt; 01:49:26.870
but I got counseled by my students. And and the strange thing is, in the last

967
01:49:26.950 --&gt; 01:49:32.679
Abimereki Muzaale: 2 years, or even this year, I&#39;ve been interacting with 9 Johns Hopkins people a lot.

968
01:49:32.720 --&gt; 01:49:42.740
Abimereki Muzaale: So a high school student in Florida called Calvin Matthias approached me and sent me an email in order to to be involved in a research project. I didn&#39;t even ask how I got my email.

969
01:49:42.820 --&gt; 01:49:49.529
Abimereki Muzaale: So those are ideas for this platform. This medical student is not at Johns Hopkins is in New York

970
01:49:49.740 --&gt; 01:49:50.840
Abimereki Muzaale: under arcing.

971
01:49:51.130 --&gt; 01:50:01.250
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I&#39;m working 2 projects with him. This is one project. This is why it stands. You can get details on the project

972
01:50:01.360 --&gt; 01:50:07.800
Abimereki Muzaale: here. This is called version control and Github. So you can see the history

973
01:50:07.900 --&gt; 01:50:28.670
Abimereki Muzaale: of the document we&#39;re working on. The last person to put information. Here was a collaborator called Fawaz Al Amari, but if you click on history it will tell you all. The last update was from Faraz 3 days ago. Then from Andrew 5 days ago, then earlier from me last month. So these are versions. If I click on this.

974
01:50:28.880 --&gt; 01:50:36.759
Abimereki Muzaale: it will take you to the version if I like. Click on this, take you to the version of this document in August 15,

975
01:50:36.920 --&gt; 01:50:55.840
Abimereki Muzaale: or something like that. So it&#39;s very. It&#39;s a platform that has been used in Silicon Valley, but I&#39;m trying to introduce to to to the medical world, and and as you can see II don&#39;t have bounds when I say I&#39;m in education. I&#39;m actually in education.

976
01:50:55.980 --&gt; 01:51:03.850
Abimereki Muzaale: very informal, right? Very informal. Sector. None of these are Johns Hopkins, but of course

977
01:51:03.900 --&gt; 01:51:13.560
Abimereki Muzaale: you know the faculty. Who are Johns Hopkins, so I&#39;m going. Not yet introduced this to the Department of Surgery division of transplant surgery. I haven&#39;t introduced this to them.

978
01:51:13.880 --&gt; 01:51:15.110
Patrick: but I will.

979
01:51:15.270 --&gt; 01:51:17.450
Abimereki Muzaale: And so the platform

980
01:51:17.620 --&gt; 01:51:22.190
Abimereki Muzaale: caters to an individual but gives resources.

981
01:51:22.330 --&gt; 01:51:28.190
Abimereki Muzaale: That allow for for clinical research really is a target. Yeah.

982
01:51:28.290 --&gt; 01:51:33.639
Abimereki Muzaale: clinical research. And of course, the person the services we&#39;re providing are for patients.

983
01:51:33.670 --&gt; 01:52:00.500
Abimereki Muzaale: So they the products like, online web apps that allow you to quantify risks a patient in front of you has regarding something you&#39;re planning for them or their disease or their surgery. So you should be able to put in the information and an app which we can produce under your profile, safety, profile. You&#39;re here if you, if you&#39;re ben philosoph

984
01:52:00.530 --&gt; 01:52:05.580
Abimereki Muzaale: transplant surgery. So if you know. So once

985
01:52:05.610 --&gt; 01:52:17.969
Abimereki Muzaale: to make a decision, say, he gets a call saying an organ is available, someone just died, and a donor. Does he have any patient who needs this organ? Usually the question is quality of the organ

986
01:52:18.130 --&gt; 01:52:25.129
Abimereki Muzaale: and the number of viruses involved in the quality of an organ, I can tell you. I can give you just a taste of it.

987
01:52:25.190 --&gt; 01:52:27.300
Abimereki Muzaale: You know.

988
01:52:27.530 --&gt; 01:52:32.940
Abimereki Muzaale: these are the variables. These are just the parameters. One.

989
01:52:32.960 --&gt; 01:52:54.500
Abimereki Muzaale: Th! This they may not make sense to you. Pr, a, B or group Bmi edge. These are parameters, but in them they even further things. Father Via was involved in a in quantifying the risk. So no human being can process this. In a short time you did. Transplant schedule has to make a decision in within few minutes.

990
01:52:54.500 --&gt; 01:53:03.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Should I accept that organ? So sorry if I said no, the organ is offered to the next transplant generation, maybe in another state like Philadelphia.

991
01:53:03.600 --&gt; 01:53:09.259
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. And so if Ben Philosoph wants to be able to make a quick decision.

992
01:53:09.340 --&gt; 01:53:14.270
Abimereki Muzaale: that would be for the benefit of his patients. So on a wait list. Yeah.

993
01:53:14.600 --&gt; 01:53:19.900
Abimereki Muzaale: So this is Ben. So if he so to be able to produce something that useful

994
01:53:20.040 --&gt; 01:53:33.549
Abimereki Muzaale: for faculty. That&#39;s also useful, of course, for the target features of patients. But of course we have trainees too. So have things useful for them. And so I&#39;m very excited that I was able to produce this platform.

995
01:53:33.650 --&gt; 01:53:41.239
Abimereki Muzaale: I if you told me that I produced this at the beginning of the year, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll say that said, that&#39;s crazy. Because where was I supposed to get skills to do this?

996
01:53:41.330 --&gt; 01:53:44.730
Patrick: Yeah. But

997
01:53:44.820 --&gt; 01:53:55.379
Abimereki Muzaale: the the stars connected aligned. And I did a data science class chat. Gpta arrived. and I drank a lot of coffee.

998
01:53:55.510 --&gt; 01:54:03.510
Abimereki Muzaale: and I was able to use this platform. So yes, so growth and expansion of my fana platform.

999
01:54:04.490 --&gt; 01:54:16.610
Abimereki Muzaale:  that&#39;s one request, because the bigger platform for me is a social media platform, the more useful it is. Ironically also, the bigger it is, the more it grows.

1000
01:54:16.760 --&gt; 01:54:30.569
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So yeah. So actually, I don&#39;t know. You should know Flavia. She&#39;s a sister of one of your, is she a yif person

1001
01:54:31.060 --&gt; 01:54:46.629
Abimereki Muzaale: Flavia Opio opio for me. So yes, Sasha was here. She was here a few weeks ago, and I saw shared this platform, and her mind went crazy. She was like, Oh.

1002
01:54:46.670 --&gt; 01:54:56.490
Abimereki Muzaale: she just started thinking about how I should get in touch with the health sector in Uganda, how a one-stop center

1003
01:54:56.700 --&gt; 01:55:03.960
Abimereki Muzaale: of truth. Say, if a patient, a patient, sees a doctor in Guru, yet he has records from

1004
01:55:04.140 --&gt; 01:55:06.740
Abimereki Muzaale: Carbadio Kampala.

1005
01:55:06.760 --&gt; 01:55:22.659
Abimereki Muzaale: They should be one central place where all these things can be referenced. Yeah. And she was. I was like, that&#39;s interesting ideas. And and she was like, Yeah, you seem to be able to to be in the zone of producing such a platform. And I was like, oh.

1006
01:55:22.860 --&gt; 01:55:29.170
Abimereki Muzaale: so what resulted was, oh, I guess I I&#39;m less than sharing my screen.

1007
01:55:29.870 --&gt; 01:55:37.819
Abimereki Muzaale: So that&#39;s so. I&#39;m I&#39;m thankful. But I&#39;m also praying for growth. What resulted was

1008
01:55:38.380 --&gt; 01:55:41.150
Abimereki Muzaale: me getting a call from her brother-in-law.

1009
01:55:41.530 --&gt; 01:55:43.629
Abimereki Muzaale:  Hi, Ivan!

1010
01:55:43.770 --&gt; 01:55:54.009
Abimereki Muzaale: But I haven&#39;t really followed up on this, because he called at a time when I couldn&#39;t speak. So this is all clinical, all the Us. Mostly the Us. But then, because

1011
01:55:54.600 --&gt; 01:56:01.529
Abimereki Muzaale: of some interactions I had as II created other categories, and I don&#39;t know if you know, you know, I even mumble it.

1012
01:56:02.680 --&gt; 01:56:21.469
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I got a call from him. I was like, Oh, he must have been having a chat with flavour, and he was like, yes, yes, yes, so so the platform is already growing, at least this top of it already imaging. But I want guidance

1013
01:56:21.750 --&gt; 01:56:30.060
Abimereki Muzaale: and the process of growth and the growth will be successful if it&#39;s very relevant to people.

1014
01:56:30.330 --&gt; 01:56:58.659
Abimereki Muzaale: And I don&#39;t want that to be, because this is it. I don&#39;t want there to be any geographic boundaries already. There. None. It&#39;s gone beyond Johns Hopkins. But I&#39;m I&#39;m happy to see reaching Uganda cause people like saying, When are you coming back? What are you doing for Uganda? So if this can lead me to do things directly in my area of specialty. For Uganda, I&#39;ll be very, very delighted. So that&#39;s where I&#39;m praying for growth

1015
01:56:58.780 --&gt; 01:57:04.020
Abimereki Muzaale: expansion of my finap platform. Thin platform.

1016
01:57:04.250 --&gt; 01:57:14.650
sarahkayongo: Just, general. There&#39;s a lot you can.

1017
01:57:14.840 --&gt; 01:57:19.389
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, yes, yes, yes, indeed.

1018
01:57:19.470 --&gt; 01:57:24.130
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I&#39;m clinical medicine, I know. Clinical medicine. Yes.

1019
01:57:24.310 --&gt; 01:57:29.049
Abimereki Muzaale: yes, so so you know. So I&#39;m grateful for these things that should be merged.

1020
01:57:29.060 --&gt; 01:57:32.570
Abimereki Muzaale: And I think that&#39;s it, you know. That&#39;s it for me.

1021
01:57:32.780 --&gt; 01:57:38.000
Abimereki Muzaale: J. Is not here, so you know. We we shall.

1022
01:57:38.310 --&gt; 01:57:43.619
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

1023
01:57:44.440 --&gt; 01:57:45.870
Abimereki Muzaale: a

1024
01:57:45.890 --&gt; 01:58:00.340
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. I is it to be to be a to be? I can&#39;t remember. But yes, yes, so.

1025
01:58:00.440 --&gt; 01:58:02.410
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, yes, I

1026
01:58:03.800 --&gt; 01:58:08.289
Abimereki Muzaale:  Oh, let me post this that you have. You all have access.

1027
01:58:08.840 --&gt; 01:58:09.840
Patrick: Okay?

1028
01:58:10.070 --&gt; 01:58:19.699
Abimereki Muzaale: And I can share my screen. Continue sharing that. You see me walking the Linux, I can tell you to think that I walk off a Linux terminal. That&#39;s just a whole new world for me.

1029
01:58:20.260 --&gt; 01:58:22.679
Abimereki Muzaale: and Linux command

1030
01:58:22.980 --&gt; 01:58:24.389
Abimereki Muzaale: command line.

1031
01:58:26.180 --&gt; 01:58:36.730
Abimereki Muzaale: So so I have a script which I wrote. which I call II call Abi Kissa. It&#39;s a it&#39;s a summary of Abi marriage. An ikissa.

1032
01:58:36.800 --&gt; 01:58:44.970
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s happy kiss. yeah, I can&#39;t show you what the script looks like. It looks like this cut

1033
01:58:45.320 --&gt; 01:58:47.540
Abimereki Muzaale: get because

1034
01:58:47.760 --&gt; 01:58:50.480
Abimereki Muzaale: it took me a while. I would create a script

1035
01:58:50.570 --&gt; 01:58:55.619
Abimereki Muzaale: lots of interaction with. So that&#39;s those are contents of the script.

1036
01:58:56.090 --&gt; 01:58:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: But

1037
01:58:58.010 --&gt; 01:58:59.679
Abimereki Muzaale: you&#39;ll see it in action.

1038
01:59:01.910 --&gt; 01:59:16.500
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s exactly why my prayers. I&#39;m giving thanks for AI, because I can tell you II can&#39;t recognize myself.

1039
01:59:16.850 --&gt; 01:59:36.860
Abimereki Muzaale: I I&#39;m like, what are you? Am I writing a script? Oh, a lot of time, as I can tell you, it shows on my body the body has suffered. Yeah, the body has suffered, has been neglected. Yeah, yeah, the body has been neglected.

1040
01:59:37.010 --&gt; 01:59:42.410
Patrick:  But you see, I just do these inputs and the rest is automated.

1041
01:59:43.530 --&gt; 01:59:44.260
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

1042
01:59:44.680 --&gt; 01:59:46.949

Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. okay, save, you see.

1050
02:00:15.380 --&gt; 02:00:21.629
Patrick: The automation is now on. I&#39;ve finished the input input parameters. Da da, da all this

1051
02:00:21.640 --&gt; 02:00:38.010
Abimereki Muzaale: and and the keys. Okay, that&#39;s fine. III just what I was doing is that posting all the prayers are going to be available within about 1 min on that link I&#39;ve shared. If you need me to send it again, let me know.

1052
02:00:38.020 --&gt; 02:00:41.919
Abimereki Muzaale: So that&#39;s what I was doing. I was just posting them push. So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done a pushed

1053
02:00:41.990 --&gt; 02:00:46.820
Abimereki Muzaale: them to Github. The time the time they used is push. Push them to Github

1054
02:00:46.860 --&gt; 02:00:58.860
Abimereki Muzaale: Github pages, cause that&#39;s a pub that&#39;s a URL. So within I&#39;m going to check on my side to see when it usually takes 30 s to a minute.

1055
02:00:59.170 --&gt; 02:01:02.579
Abimereki Muzaale: Let&#39;s see.

02:02:11.470 --&gt; 02:02:15.539
Abimereki Muzaale: Charlie. I&#39;m gonna stop recording. I don&#39;t think we need to record the prayer.

sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t know

2
00:00:02.600 --&gt; 00:00:05.030
sarahkayongo: you dumb down everything

3
00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:20.320
sarahkayongo: and making

4
00:00:20.380 --&gt; 00:00:30.219
sarahkayongo: they they can undermine you in a way, because you&#39;re disposable. You&#39;re not that powerful, and you&#39;re crossing level. Yeah, exactly.

5
00:00:30.600 --&gt; 00:00:35.749
Martin Muwaga: But and another thing with these guys who are not raised, though the view way

6
00:00:35.920 --&gt; 00:00:43.579
Martin Muwaga: life only presents binary choices. So if you&#39;re not in the account. you can only be against them.

7
00:00:44.290 --&gt; 00:00:47.769
Patrick Muinda: So it is. That&#39;s how

8
00:00:48.320 --&gt; 00:00:52.050
Patrick Muinda: you have Friday.

9
00:00:52.090 --&gt; 00:01:18.310
Patrick Muinda: Do you have friends that secretaries also cause. Once. I have made friends with them at office, and even out of office. I have one of her closest friends is Dan Rotiva. If you&#39;re not done, rotivo has tried

10
00:01:19.220 --&gt; 00:01:24.739
Patrick Muinda: school is Buddha Buddha, and also the the same fellowship.

11
00:01:24.840 --&gt; 00:01:28.630
Abimereki Muzaale: Hey? So we&#39;re joining. So joining those up.

12
00:01:28.740 --&gt; 00:01:31.759
Martin Muwaga: he took 5. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:32.090 --&gt; 00:01:50.480
Martin Muwaga: So. So you don&#39;t know her because she she&#39;s 1970. You don&#39;t have Coach, Patty. I&#39;m not saying make friends with her friends, I&#39;m saying, make friends with everyone around her from the secretaries, everyone so that they can give you information.

14
00:01:50.660 --&gt; 00:01:55.769
sarahkayongo: And then that one I&#39;ve done. That&#39;s what I have done effectively.

15
00:01:55.930 --&gt; 00:02:19.420
sarahkayongo: And and they they sneak information to me, and II just marvel II marvel. In fact, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I have understood you, sir. First of all, it starts by being overwhelming. That&#39;s the first thing.

16
00:02:19.520 --&gt; 00:02:34.430
Patrick Muinda: You just can&#39;t believe it all. Then, after that you say, Okay, fine. How do I navigate through this. So I begin doing that now. Having chatted, let&#39;s say with Dan, you know now, now she she she can&#39;t tell that I have information.

17
00:02:34.510 --&gt; 00:02:38.900
and she finally opened up and said, I even told Dan, ABC, ABC.

18
00:02:39.100 --&gt; 00:02:46.400
Patrick Muinda: So now Dan calls me and says, Man, what&#39;s going on we call her number 8, number 8 on eighth floor.

19
00:02:46.500 --&gt; 00:02:53.309
Patrick Muinda: Number 8 is very, very cold to me these days. Talk to her, and she&#39;s not as receptive.

20
00:02:53.440 --&gt; 00:02:56.949
Now see how this thing is now infecting done as well.

21
00:02:57.210 --&gt; 00:03:00.310
Patrick Muinda: So so it is a a game

22
00:03:00.330 --&gt; 00:03:05.319
whereby you need so much energy to play, and I realize that

23
00:03:05.760 --&gt; 00:03:19.589
Patrick Muinda: 1, 1, 1. 1. One thing that must not be discounted is the fact that we should take this thing to God in prayer cause. The the more we use this effort and energy and and brilliance and tact.

24
00:03:19.980 --&gt; 00:03:22.020
Patrick Muinda: the more exhausted we get.

25
00:03:22.240 --&gt; 00:03:27.290
Patrick Muinda: Cause I didn&#39;t see her. She she she also is very. She looks frustrated, and

26
00:03:27.300 --&gt; 00:03:33.340
Patrick Muinda: she just is so walked up by so many things. I think she thinks that I report her directly to the first link.

27
00:03:33.640 --&gt; 00:03:37.050
Martin Muwaga: and and and the that context to very

28
00:03:37.650 --&gt; 00:03:51.309
Martin Muwaga: that context is so important for you guys to understand he&#39;s in that peculiar situation. And and yet I don&#39;t. I&#39;m not even as close to the first lady as she. Well, party perception is real at all.

29
00:03:51.430 --&gt; 00:03:58.810
Patrick Muinda: Everything, everything, everything she&#39;s talking about in meetings I am relaying direct.

30
00:03:59.000 --&gt; 00:04:11.540
Martin Muwaga: so so that one is like befriending an ask.

31
00:04:11.910 --&gt; 00:04:33.350
Martin Muwaga: Yes, very difficult. That lady is a very difficult individual context. She&#39;s a 1970 model pretty much like you no kids, no husband. She lives

32
00:04:33.360 --&gt; 00:04:53.690
Martin Muwaga: so that that that you also have to understand. Because, again, this may sound stuff Gen. Z. People can&#39;t relate with. But these something like when we get these new bosses, and they introduce themselves. And they say, I have 3 kids. They&#39;re all young. This is in their forties. We are like.

33
00:04:54.160 --&gt; 00:05:15.829
Martin Muwaga: she has a instruction. Everyone rejoins.

34
00:05:23.750 --&gt; 00:05:30.310
sarahkayongo: I wanted to share a screen.

35
00:05:30.450 --&gt; 00:05:35.109
sarahkayongo: Janet is 16 13, I think.

36
00:05:35.870 --&gt; 00:05:43.499
sarahkayongo: The story of hey, guys, she&#39;s never mentioned. No one talks about her except that

37
00:05:43.790 --&gt; 00:05:45.810
sarahkayongo: 16. What?

38
00:05:46.280 --&gt; 00:05:50.289
sarahkayongo: Genesis? 1613.

39
00:05:54.350 --&gt; 00:06:05.960
sarahkayongo: So that woman I read different commentary. So basically, it&#39;s a story of the slave woman. Abraham&#39;s that Abraham&#39;s film.

40
00:06:06.050 --&gt; 00:06:14.970
sarahkayongo: Yeah, Ishmael. And then Sarah gets mad and they throw her out, and she goes with the sign, and they don&#39;t know where they&#39;re heading.

41
00:06:15.020 --&gt; 00:06:19.040
Martin Muwaga:  But they really stay. Now, booming. Yeah.

42
00:06:19.150 --&gt; 00:06:34.420
sarahkayongo: which must have been written by a guy, cause that guy says, you see how I put everything so nicely. The guy says.

43
00:06:34.710 --&gt; 00:06:56.340
sarahkayongo: the woman who was sexually abused and and used. And

44
00:06:57.150 --&gt; 00:07:08.339
sarahkayongo: yeah, but can you imagine sexually abuse, and then just left. So anyway. That first, says the Lord who sees me

45
00:07:08.540 --&gt; 00:07:11.489
sarahkayongo: and God God saw her.

46
00:07:11.910 --&gt; 00:07:19.050
sarahkayongo: you know he saw her sorrow, and and he provided more. Yeah, her pain and her sorrow.

47
00:07:19.100 --&gt; 00:07:23.250
sarahkayongo: and he provided water for them in the desert.

48
00:07:23.300 --&gt; 00:07:31.780
sarahkayongo: and he also promised that her son who will be prosperous, and they will become a great

49
00:07:32.250 --&gt; 00:07:43.209
sarahkayongo: and and the reason, you know, I watch so many Netflix things when I watch Dubai blink. Dubai, I&#39;m like, Wow, these people.

50
00:07:43.510 --&gt; 00:07:45.110
sarahkayongo: So wealthy.

51
00:07:45.140 --&gt; 00:08:00.830
sarahkayongo: But you know, it&#39;s because God actually also had a promise for them. So.

52
00:08:01.290 --&gt; 00:08:08.079
sarahkayongo: Isaac, yeah, something else. Isha, Isha Krovin. The Israelites are the covenant ones.

53
00:08:08.090 --&gt; 00:08:19.009
sarahkayongo: but whether you&#39;re coming up or not, but God gave a promise to Abraham, that&#39;s all his descendants, all of them.

54
00:08:19.070 --&gt; 00:08:34.200
sarahkayongo: So so man cries out, and God answers her before she even, and he tells her to look around. And this water, and and they they also got this promise that her children will be prosperous.

55
00:08:34.289 --&gt; 00:08:41.610
sarahkayongo: So she! And then that other comment, she, aol Roy

56
00:08:41.630 --&gt; 00:08:44.800
sarahkayongo: in Hebrew, means the word who sees me

57
00:08:44.840 --&gt; 00:08:49.420
sarahkayongo: so the person she talked to Angel wherever

58
00:08:49.530 --&gt; 00:09:08.140
sarahkayongo: said she was like, Oh, my gosh, you you mean God has seen me, and I&#39;ve seen a message of God. So in in Hebrew they say that, and actually in the entire Old Testament no one has given God a name except her.

59
00:09:08.250 --&gt; 00:09:12.350
sarahkayongo: she called him the good who sees me. aero.

60
00:09:12.910 --&gt; 00:09:23.309
sarahkayongo: so don&#39;t worry. stick to your custody when you&#39;re in the house. When you leave the house, pray for protection.

61
00:09:23.540 --&gt; 00:09:29.229
sarahkayongo: Amen. The house out, out, out in the walk to this

62
00:09:29.350 --&gt; 00:09:43.209
Martin Muwaga: God is on your side, and he sees, I mean for everyone. The the Lord sees us and party, what is what? Yeah, what is? How does your immediate boss? Because your immediate boss isn&#39;t the PS. The undersecretary?

63
00:09:43.510 --&gt; 00:09:46.749
Martin Muwaga: How does she right under the Ps.

64
00:09:47.150 --&gt; 00:09:49.670
Patrick Muinda: Number 2,

65
00:09:49.780 --&gt; 00:09:57.820
Patrick Muinda: the Under Secretary? You should. Did I show you my my appraise? So I thought I oh, sorry I sent you to Durham

66
00:09:57.920 --&gt; 00:10:05.110
Patrick Muinda: when she had finished appraising. May I shared it with breath before, to know the mind of my boss about me and my work? My boss thinks

67
00:10:05.170 --&gt; 00:10:06.739
I am incredible.

68
00:10:07.090 --&gt; 00:10:08.820
sarahkayongo: Oh, delicious! Nice!

69
00:10:09.150 --&gt; 00:10:17.430
Patrick Muinda: She thinks I am not ordinary at all. I do my work. I don&#39;t just do my work. I do it well, and I do it above

70
00:10:17.470 --&gt; 00:10:19.360
Patrick Muinda: and beyond what it should be.

71
00:10:19.400 --&gt; 00:10:38.230
Patrick Muinda: An ordinary person. Be wheelbarrow style. Just go exactly where you&#39;re supposed to go, but II do, I put in extra, and she recognizes that. And she really loves me. When I walk into her office she&#39;s already smiling. She&#39;s laughing. She even when she&#39;s on phone. No, come in, come in. She really really loves me so much.

72
00:10:38.480 --&gt; 00:10:45.809
Patrick Muinda: Now, when it comes to me, her and the overall boss number, because I&#39;m I&#39;m at level 3 in the ministry.

73
00:10:46.220 --&gt; 00:10:50.569
Patrick Muinda: so the other one is CEO. Then comes her, then comes me

74
00:10:50.610 --&gt; 00:10:56.779
Patrick Muinda: my level. So when we are 3, and we are all in the context of work.

75
00:10:57.010 --&gt; 00:10:59.140
I can see my boss also.

76
00:10:59.500 --&gt; 00:11:03.000
Patrick Muinda: just just doing enough to protect me.

77
00:11:03.040 --&gt; 00:11:05.780
sarahkayongo: but not not trying to antagonize

78
00:11:05.960 --&gt; 00:11:16.930
Patrick Muinda: the CEO by showing her that she&#39;s on my side. so I can understand. She also needs to protect her skin. But when we are together she says, no, you know what what just happened there. Ignore it.

79
00:11:17.570 --&gt; 00:11:23.389
sarahkayongo: Continue doing, ABC.

80
00:11:23.800 --&gt; 00:11:35.960
sarahkayongo: But all of you guys, you you&#39;ve all been very successful. God has seen us through up to this stage.

81
00:11:36.130 --&gt; 00:11:37.939
Patrick Muinda: That that is so true.

82
00:11:38.020 --&gt; 00:11:42.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I&#39;ve been transformed very slowly

83
00:11:42.550 --&gt; 00:11:44.030
Abimereki Muzaale: from childhood to now.

84
00:11:44.660 --&gt; 00:11:49.180
sarahkayongo: Been doing very micro evolutions every year.

85
00:11:49.680 --&gt; 00:11:50.590
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

86
00:11:51.230 --&gt; 00:11:52.360
Martin Muwaga: Pete

87
00:11:52.760 --&gt; 00:12:09.660
Martin Muwaga: Khadi. There&#39;s there&#39;s one thing I think I don&#39;t know about, Sarah, but I&#39;ll speak for the men here. I&#39;ve heard from Khadi. I&#39;ve had from Patty, and I can relate it with it, too, at the workplace. I&#39;ve also received feedback from being

88
00:12:09.710 --&gt; 00:12:15.660
Martin Muwaga: about being critical when something is not being done. And I just.

89
00:12:15.750 --&gt; 00:12:20.290
Martin Muwaga: I&#39;ve I&#39;ve also gotten it. So could we? Maybe party probably be a little more.

90
00:12:20.620 --&gt; 00:12:24.500
Martin Muwaga: are aware about this and realize that people&#39;s

91
00:12:24.530 --&gt; 00:12:26.290
Martin Muwaga: people&#39;s ability.

92
00:12:34.460 --&gt; 00:12:40.159
Patrick Muinda: I know that made it clear.

93
00:12:40.990 --&gt; 00:12:46.759
Patrick Muinda: My boss made it very clear, and she says we need to strike a balance between good governance

94
00:12:46.820 --&gt; 00:12:49.840
Abimereki Muzaale: and what politics requires.

95
00:12:49.920 --&gt; 00:12:52.520
Patrick Muinda: I got the point loud and clear.

96
00:12:53.280 --&gt; 00:13:04.260
Patrick Muinda: So she says she&#39;s a Christian. She compromises incredibly incredible compromise, and and I&#39;m not using the other negative words. I&#39;m leaving it at compromise.

97
00:13:04.320 --&gt; 00:13:06.969
Patrick Muinda: She knows how to get her Christianity

98
00:13:06.990 --&gt; 00:13:10.920
Patrick Muinda: and not balance it out. Her beliefs is what what she has to do.

99
00:13:37.080 --&gt; 00:13:51.350
sarahkayongo: You can come off as a mud black woman already. You&#39;re mad, black woman, but I&#39;ve I&#39;ve never, ever ever raised my voice. Actually, it&#39;s funny at work.

100
00:13:51.350 --&gt; 00:14:10.370
sarahkayongo: I just go, you know I just first of all, if it took endless. I want to buy you, get it, and and you know who that do as the workers and the Nan and the talkers. So I don&#39;t argue now, because I know everyone&#39;s working style. After a while

101
00:14:10.390 --&gt; 00:14:35.960
sarahkayongo: I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t argue. I&#39;m agreeable. So all these terms. Yeah, I&#39;m agreeable. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t give off any 5 of you know. No, no, no! And I understand the boundaries. I understand their little terminologies.

102
00:14:35.960 --&gt; 00:14:46.820
sarahkayongo: and I don&#39;t try to trigger when it comes to deliverables. No one can beat me on on delivering so.

103
00:14:47.030 --&gt; 00:14:54.180
sarahkayongo: And then this little girl&#39;s journey, you and I over would judge, you know, Georgetown, Owen, or too

104
00:14:54.280 --&gt; 00:14:58.959
sarahkayongo:  extra. What&#39;s that? What they use?

105
00:14:59.730 --&gt; 00:15:01.329
Patrick Muinda: to include? Deep?

106
00:15:01.820 --&gt; 00:15:10.979
sarahkayongo: No, they just want their their work, basically, and then they will take it, or they will hear things, you know

107
00:15:11.280 --&gt; 00:15:32.770
sarahkayongo: extra. What&#39;s the word? The terminology? Do you have genesis use exprop pro appropriate. You can work with them on a project, they would take your work and make it theirs.

108
00:15:32.820 --&gt; 00:15:41.470
sarahkayongo: So you have to be careful with them. Is there a way, approach them because they like to Google everything I tell them, and just give them

109
00:15:41.740 --&gt; 00:15:48.530
sarahkayongo: things in general terms. Oh, Sarah, can we meet? And you show us how to

110
00:16:16.330 --&gt; 00:16:32.530
Abimereki Muzaale: but

111
00:16:32.560 --&gt; 00:16:35.100
Abimereki Muzaale: they do it without blinking.

112
00:16:35.220 --&gt; 00:16:36.990
sarahkayongo: Yeah, you can&#39;t even believe

113
00:16:37.410 --&gt; 00:16:41.030
Patrick Muinda: what? Taking on your work and making it yours.

114
00:16:41.100 --&gt; 00:16:42.389
sarahkayongo: Yeah, it does.

115
00:16:42.870 --&gt; 00:17:00.969
sarahkayongo: hey? But then they cannot defend it. So that&#39;s

116
00:17:26.880 --&gt; 00:17:33.600
Abimereki Muzaale: and like, so what are you working on? That&#39;s it. I&#39;m not just that kind of question. Yeah.

117
00:17:33.640 --&gt; 00:17:46.919
Abimereki Muzaale: then, 2 months later, calling II didn&#39;t attend some conference, and a colleague sends me text message from the conference like someone. I just presented this from another institution.

118
00:17:47.180 --&gt; 00:17:54.179
Abimereki Muzaale: probable that at the same time this is improbable topic that II

119
00:17:54.240 --&gt; 00:18:03.300
Abimereki Muzaale: focused on someone that also did it. At the same time, that&#39;s almost impossible. Statistically. yeah, and

120
00:18:03.580 --&gt; 00:18:13.890
Abimereki Muzaale: I knew the idea elsewhere. Hopkins.

121
00:18:13.900 --&gt; 00:18:19.899
sarahkayongo: And I hate to say this, but this one goes up only 9

122
00:18:19.960 --&gt; 00:18:40.019
Abimereki Muzaale: but same.

123
00:18:40.070 --&gt; 00:18:52.950
Abimereki Muzaale: this one is the only person.

124
00:18:53.860 --&gt; 00:18:56.390
Abimereki Muzaale: Wonder why my motivation

125
00:19:20.770 --&gt; 00:19:33.979
sarahkayongo: so for us we walk in the office with your acidity. Cut people don&#39;t talk, and I was like, hey, there&#39;s no small talk, boy, you guys, I guess I know.

126
00:19:33.980 --&gt; 00:19:55.479
sarahkayongo: Oh, I can help you with that, though. Dump their walk on. You kind of you have to create this boundaries? And no, what&#39;s the we have those simple questions, what&#39;s the level of level of effort level

127
00:19:55.640 --&gt; 00:19:57.300
sarahkayongo: that going on?

128
00:19:57.400 --&gt; 00:20:01.850
Martin Muwaga: No, it is, it is. It is a metric for billing.

129
00:20:02.240 --&gt; 00:20:04.179
Abimereki Muzaale: You can&#39;t believe that no

130
00:20:04.410 --&gt; 00:20:05.850
Abimereki Muzaale: like 30%.

131
00:20:06.020 --&gt; 00:20:34.250
sarahkayongo: If if you&#39;re giving me one, my very colleague, senior other fellow technical advisors

132
00:20:34.450 --&gt; 00:20:39.899
sarahkayongo: they want. They wanted to still out talk with them, and then they go to meetings, guys.

133
00:20:40.070 --&gt; 00:21:00.869
sarahkayongo: and they will talk more. And they&#39;re sharing all my ideas, I, and direct it out. You know what happened now, they discovered. Oh, okay, but we can go with all these trips, some of them. You see me going on like in December. This guy I played him. I told him you want. I can help you with this.

134
00:21:01.090 --&gt; 00:21:08.110
But it would take time for me to do that would probably need to go together. Okay, then come.

135
00:21:08.220 --&gt; 00:21:16.739
sarahkayongo: come with me to Kenya and and Ethiopia, and that

136
00:21:16.820 --&gt; 00:21:27.789
sarahkayongo: he what he needed me to help him. So I&#39;m like, no, no, no, the only way I can help you is is if we go to the field office together because I cannot write without evidence.

137
00:21:27.940 --&gt; 00:21:36.000
sarahkayongo: Yeah, yeah, come with me, and then you help me talk to this Kenyan stakeholders.

138
00:21:36.230 --&gt; 00:21:42.780
sarahkayongo: Then we wrote a good report together. But I was not gonna write for him. And then he steals my ideas.

139
00:21:43.260 --&gt; 00:21:45.280
Patrick Muinda: Yeah,

140
00:21:45.520 --&gt; 00:21:47.600
Martin Muwaga: yeah. So yeah, guys.

141
00:21:48.280 --&gt; 00:21:58.679
Martin Muwaga: II know th, this has really been. If you ask, it has really been help, because this is a topic which up applies. But you know one of the things that leads

142
00:21:58.980 --&gt; 00:21:59.780
Martin Muwaga: to

143
00:22:00.290 --&gt; 00:22:08.799
Martin Muwaga: frustration. And you really start feeling you&#39;re in a bad place is when you personalize a situation. What&#39;s happening to you is not peculiar.

144
00:22:09.460 --&gt; 00:22:15.249
sarahkayongo: It is something. It&#39;s. It&#39;s a landscape that we are all having to

145
00:22:15.530 --&gt; 00:22:20.800
Martin Muwaga: to to navigate, but is one of the things that really helps me.

146
00:22:21.250 --&gt; 00:22:31.089
Martin Muwaga: Actually, my reaction is a bit different as not giving you the advice that I follow when I know someone is negative and all that. I do not let them know that I know.

147
00:22:31.150 --&gt; 00:22:40.789
Martin Muwaga: because what happened in the case of party is that when Katy go to land at Rotiva. had had this information, had

148
00:22:40.910 --&gt; 00:22:59.100
Martin Muwaga: provided this information to Patrick she became even more hostile. She&#39;s like this guy now. Must be coming after me full place. So old news about keeping your friends close and your enemies closer that stuff you think, Jay, because

149
00:22:59.280 --&gt; 00:23:06.869
Abimereki Muzaale: being honest sharing when you&#39;re meeting someone for the first time in walk, even me when I met Dory II the first time.

150
00:23:06.950 --&gt; 00:23:23.759
Abimereki Muzaale: I just yeah. But that may not be very strategic. Yeah. So so giving people all in the information they need is something that I never used to consider.

151
00:23:48.510 --&gt; 00:24:01.020
Abimereki Muzaale: But when he comes back

152
00:24:01.020 --&gt; 00:24:03.109
Martin Muwaga: to consider, view his dysfunction.

153
00:24:03.200 --&gt; 00:24:09.159
Martin Muwaga: which skills that did I acquire. I mean a lamb. your lovedness.

154
00:24:09.180 --&gt; 00:24:15.239
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yes. So you know, I got that skill so rich doesn&#39;t have much value in America.

155
00:24:15.520 --&gt; 00:24:31.960
Abimereki Muzaale: But how come? How come that skills. It worked for your dad in the seventies. It ingratiated him so many. I&#39;m unwilling. Iii life for me is not worth living in that position.

156
00:25:00.080 --&gt; 00:25:08.949
sarahkayongo: Yeah, under. That makes it impossible, completely impossible for me to be like him. I can&#39;t.

157
00:25:09.060 --&gt; 00:25:15.110
Martin Muwaga: And his peers get shocked because Elizabeth Murram came and lived next to us in dar es salaam.

158
00:25:15.170 --&gt; 00:25:35.470
Martin Muwaga: So we used to go across with bread for dinner, and should be saying stuff, and I&#39;ll just tell her. She was shocked. Everything, so I can tell that this is I had very. So. I used to be invited around Christmas time to

159
00:25:35.500 --&gt; 00:25:38.170
Abimereki Muzaale: 7 friends places, for

160
00:25:38.430 --&gt; 00:25:45.230
Abimereki Muzaale: you know th, these are no Christians so it doesn&#39;t. Christian music does this holiday music. You had to play music

161
00:25:45.510 --&gt; 00:25:50.029
Abimereki Muzaale: around Christmas time, you know. Ho! Holiday music.

162
00:25:50.540 --&gt; 00:25:54.900
Martin Muwaga: And I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been yesterday.

163
00:25:54.990 --&gt; 00:26:12.859
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s all in reflection is like, Wait a minute. When did the invitation stop? You know every yeah, without fail. But it&#39;s only a reflection. I realize I haven&#39;t been invited some of those events in over 8 to 10 years. I didn&#39;t notice it.

164
00:26:12.960 --&gt; 00:26:22.640
Abimereki Muzaale: But I now know why. No, I mean I know why, because II could tell the nature of the relationship that was naturally.

165
00:26:23.180 --&gt; 00:26:27.870
Abimereki Muzaale: The bones. It was a sort of relationship with Mom&#39;s and Daddy Yup.

166
00:26:27.910 --&gt; 00:26:33.120
Martin Muwaga: zoom Liberals, just like Amara. Yeah.

167
00:26:33.190 --&gt; 00:26:39.110
Abimereki Muzaale: But then tend to realize, oh, this fill up? Yeah, is,

168
00:26:39.250 --&gt; 00:26:41.510
Abimereki Muzaale: does not seem to be position.

169
00:26:41.680 --&gt; 00:26:55.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah, I don&#39;t know my place. Yeah. So there&#39;s an implied hierarchy. And if you acting as if your equals people actually that look all sweet and nice.

170
00:26:55.460 --&gt; 00:26:58.869
Abimereki Muzaale: since to be comfortable, this is to enjoy their relationship.

171
00:26:59.580 --&gt; 00:27:03.750
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, they enjoy it when it&#39;s very clear there&#39;s a hierarchy

172
00:27:28.270 --&gt; 00:27:34.180
sarahkayongo: unless you go somewhere.

173
00:27:34.250 --&gt; 00:28:01.649
sarahkayongo: II had a a former boss in Georgia who would teach me, should say you went to that meeting. Where did someone associate in proximity to this one? So who spoke might check, who&#39;s spoken? Who did this? And and I was like should be no Z. She was teaching me hierarchy. Now for me my situation. Hierarchy became a very. I can remember the day yeah, when I was like, okay, this one. I know what direction I&#39;m going to take.

174
00:28:01.740 --&gt; 00:28:09.620
Abimereki Muzaale: I mean academia. And we&#39;re dealing with science. And when leaders in the area and I&#39;m in a meeting with Dory, one on one.

175
00:28:10.040 --&gt; 00:28:16.509
Abimereki Muzaale: and we&#39;re going over some idea of developing. And that seems to be very important. And

176
00:28:16.770 --&gt; 00:28:25.669
Abimereki Muzaale: we disagree on steady, decided stuff calls trying to show that is a modern democratic person, you know.

177
00:28:25.710 --&gt; 00:28:35.770
Abimereki Muzaale: He calls colleague one of the colleagues that used to invite me for Christmas is John, email.

178
00:28:35.910 --&gt; 00:28:37.570
Abimereki Muzaale: Explain to him

179
00:28:38.220 --&gt; 00:28:44.680
Abimereki Muzaale: the situation you&#39;re in and the 2 defiring ideas. Yeah.

180
00:28:44.760 --&gt; 00:28:58.609
Abimereki Muzaale: And then we&#39;ll choose, because that&#39;s 3, 3. I share this idea, this idea.

181
00:28:58.680 --&gt; 00:29:04.780
Abimereki Muzaale: And as soon as the email goes, there is a very follow up on emails like Abby&#39;s not being clear.

182
00:29:05.170 --&gt; 00:29:08.399
Abimereki Muzaale: Abby says this, and I say this.

183
00:29:09.270 --&gt; 00:29:22.020
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

184
00:29:42.730 --&gt; 00:29:43.790
Abimereki Muzaale: because

185
00:29:43.800 --&gt; 00:29:45.560
Martin Muwaga: it is a sustainable question.

186
00:29:45.680 --&gt; 00:29:54.979
Abimereki Muzaale: what&#39;s the point? I didn&#39;t come from Egango to Baltimore? To

187
00:29:55.260 --&gt; 00:29:59.500
Abimereki Muzaale: to to tell people to explain it. So then let&#39;s say.

188
00:29:59.690 --&gt; 00:30:01.450
Martin Muwaga: yeah, that&#39;s the utmost.

189
00:30:01.780 --&gt; 00:30:08.370
sarahkayongo: There are more standard deviations between market. And

190
00:30:24.290 --&gt; 00:30:29.030
Martin Muwaga: but it started getting darker, and with their chauffeur being kaka.

191
00:30:29.400 --&gt; 00:30:31.109
Martin Muwaga: they had to make a call.

192
00:30:31.630 --&gt; 00:30:38.829
Patrick Muinda: They couldn&#39;t risk making it. But actually lives in Busan. But yeah, sure they couldn&#39;t. They go and stay in Grace Place.

193
00:30:40.830 --&gt; 00:30:46.360
Martin Muwaga: Well, yeah, but that is, that&#39;s that&#39;s true. But II

194
00:30:47.360 --&gt; 00:30:52.430
Martin Muwaga: II do not know. I do not know, Patsy, how the deaddies are still

195
00:30:52.800 --&gt; 00:31:07.090
Martin Muwaga: you you know some of these relationships that he had when he he was chair, and I promise all these cases showed up for your foot years, marriage anniversary. They are going to be

196
00:31:07.450 --&gt; 00:31:14.129
Martin Muwaga: by either way before I forget something. Yeah, I should. It&#39;s good that I bring this up right away. I time is all

197
00:31:14.250 --&gt; 00:31:17.559
Martin Muwaga: the essence. The other day II went to see

198
00:31:18.090 --&gt; 00:31:27.590
Martin Muwaga: that the end, you know, one of the things I dread most after we finish our meetings with, that is, when they are walking us out. Mom usually stays at the door

199
00:31:27.660 --&gt; 00:31:30.939
Martin Muwaga: that it proceeds a little further. The same economy.

200
00:31:31.700 --&gt; 00:31:35.460
Martin Muwaga: and says, You know this, seeing each of

201
00:31:35.610 --&gt; 00:31:47.149
Martin Muwaga: you people the 4 of you. Okuba wonti molecular your money collectively. I really really feel in Timothy Kumbi, sir.

202
00:31:47.350 --&gt; 00:31:52.230
Martin Muwaga: like a welfare pass. This is supposed to be a very personal thing

203
00:31:52.490 --&gt; 00:31:58.130
Martin Muwaga: which each of you bringing to me.

204
00:31:58.650 --&gt; 00:32:07.719
Martin Muwaga: And I was like, okay? And then he says, and and I live in. In. In addition to that, there is this lack of predictability.

205
00:32:07.970 --&gt; 00:32:14.469
Martin Muwaga: Yeah, supposed to show up

206
00:32:14.560 --&gt; 00:32:17.969
Martin Muwaga: with these contributions. II you know the.

207
00:32:18.310 --&gt; 00:32:32.889
Martin Muwaga: So I was like, okay, that it that the bit on the timing. I agree. I think we need to do much better. We can agree on a timeline when we are supposed to be getting this stuff. But as like Daddy, this second bit

208
00:32:32.930 --&gt; 00:32:39.019
Martin Muwaga: whereby you set into we are like giving you some welfare thing. You&#39;re getting one collective thing. I was like dead

209
00:32:39.040 --&gt; 00:33:02.810
Martin Muwaga: perception. II you know, Kadika, this is that I indulge, Daddy. But what I told Daddy is that just look at the alternative reaction here when mommy, because I told him he knows that Patty very publicly use mommy, her contribution habit. I said, when mommy gets hers, mommy, daddy is so grateful. She writes each of us individually, she doesn&#39;t take it.

210
00:33:02.870 --&gt; 00:33:04.159
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So

211
00:33:04.290 --&gt; 00:33:11.639
Martin Muwaga: I say, Daddy, but I apologize if this is how it was perceived. I said, so. What is going to happen is that this lump sum

212
00:33:11.680 --&gt; 00:33:23.340
Martin Muwaga: is going to be split up. and you will receive it individually from everyone, and again goes quiet. Because, I said, the laptop will be split up. It&#39;s like no, no, no.

213
00:33:23.400 --&gt; 00:33:29.819
Martin Muwaga: it doesn&#39;t really have to be a case of splitting up the lumps. And it&#39;s as and when someone wants to

214
00:33:30.820 --&gt; 00:33:56.260
sarahkayongo: to to compile, that&#39;s the point

215
00:33:56.280 --&gt; 00:34:01.869
Martin Muwaga: his hands. The my point over here is that we need to have a date.

216
00:34:02.100 --&gt; 00:34:09.949
Martin Muwaga: We need to have a deep the way we have standing orders for stuff. and we just make sure that we we get this stuff to pee.

217
00:34:10.300 --&gt; 00:34:27.490
Martin Muwaga: you know, because I was so tempted to give him my contribution, but particularly, quite rightly said, no, let Jody hold on to your contribution. Wait for for for all of us to be ready, but II think we should just

218
00:34:27.699 --&gt; 00:34:45.039
sarahkayongo: just locking it. I mean, II apologize for this month, but maybe like

219
00:34:45.070 --&gt; 00:34:46.239
sarahkayongo: teach me

220
00:34:46.440 --&gt; 00:35:05.310
Martin Muwaga: no. And and can you reminded me the 4 of us are all on the same page. Don&#39;t allow, don&#39;t allow that so much peace. It has caused stability, and and we&#39;re some kind of

221
00:35:05.860 --&gt; 00:35:09.810
Patrick Muinda: less reduced reduced tension at all.

222
00:35:10.260 --&gt; 00:35:12.530
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, that&#39;s so nice

223
00:35:12.760 --&gt; 00:35:24.330
Martin Muwaga: for for me, I think. Let&#39;s carry on that we&#39;ve been doing on the same bed.

224
00:35:24.560 --&gt; 00:35:36.239
Patrick Muinda: This is yours. This is from all of us. And mommy, mommy, you&#39;re taking care of everything.

225
00:35:36.290 --&gt; 00:35:42.549
Patrick Muinda: mom, you&#39;re taking care of the food, everything that needs to be done.

226
00:35:43.030 --&gt; 00:35:46.969
Patrick Muinda: And then I tell her things to do with Zafar. You let me know directly

227
00:35:47.270 --&gt; 00:35:52.949
Patrick Muinda: if the car is an issue, you need a new battery. You need this. Let me. Yeah, know.

228
00:35:53.100 --&gt; 00:35:56.169
Martin Muwaga: Let me. Yeah, daddy, this is just for your wedding.

229
00:35:56.270 --&gt; 00:36:01.569
Martin Muwaga: Just keep it. If you don&#39;t need to spend. If you need to go for aircraft. Let me know.

230
00:36:02.520 --&gt; 00:36:26.820
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. By the way, you guys may not know if I tell him, but in addition to that, III cover the utilities that use to cover reading very well

231
00:36:26.820 --&gt; 00:36:33.880
Martin Muwaga: around. I need to have all the money like $240. So it&#39;s not

232
00:36:33.880 --&gt; 00:36:39.910
sarahkayongo: yeah. So so, Le. But you know, rather than having a date.

233
00:36:40.100 --&gt; 00:36:48.419
Martin Muwaga: I would rather have the one which is predictable is the American way of saying it where we so that party will remit the fast Monday

234
00:36:48.460 --&gt; 00:36:56.430
Martin Muwaga: of the month. Something like that. Yeah, that&#39;s the first abandoned

235
00:36:56.490 --&gt; 00:37:02.999
sarahkayongo: cause, you know, for us. We are paid or not. You know how it is bi weekly, and then

236
00:37:03.580 --&gt; 00:37:10.290
Martin Muwaga: paycheck to paycheck. So so I do not know this thing

237
00:37:10.430 --&gt; 00:37:21.170
sarahkayongo: with this thing. Of course it is the end of September thing which we are we are talking about right now. Next week, on Monday or Tuesday you should have mine.

238
00:37:22.210 --&gt; 00:37:24.999
Martin Muwaga: Okay, so can we say Tuesday.

239
00:37:25.450 --&gt; 00:37:33.340
sarahkayongo: II wide a lot of money last week.

240
00:37:33.480 --&gt; 00:37:39.530
Abimereki Muzaale: I believe it&#39;s to how much send Wave kind of allow me to send.

241
00:37:39.940 --&gt; 00:37:43.100
sarahkayongo: I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t do yours.

242
00:37:43.300 --&gt; 00:37:45.550
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, got it, I kind of say, got it

243
00:37:45.820 --&gt; 00:37:53.560
Martin Muwaga: so, Jason, are we? Ca, can we, Sarah? Identitiate? Which date are we saying we&#39;re we&#39;re going to Tuesday.

244
00:37:53.860 --&gt; 00:37:55.999
Patrick Muinda: That is 3 days from now.

245
00:37:56.060 --&gt; 00:37:57.650
sarahkayongo: Yeah, okay, that&#39;s fine.

246
00:37:58.220 --&gt; 00:38:04.700
Martin Muwaga: So, Pete, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll send it. I&#39;ll send you the funds, and and then we agree

247
00:38:04.860 --&gt; 00:38:09.179
Abimereki Muzaale: from there on. Will it be the first Monday?

248
00:38:09.250 --&gt; 00:38:12.339
sarahkayongo: Yeah, that&#39;s fine. It sounds reasonable.

249
00:38:12.570 --&gt; 00:38:18.179
Patrick Muinda: Guys. Remember II you know you&#39;re praying for me about what happened? My salary?

250
00:38:18.310 --&gt; 00:38:26.119
Patrick Muinda: Yes, yes, and that&#39;s why II was not able to contribute effectively last week as only contributing in kind way I could

251
00:38:42.480 --&gt; 00:38:47.779
Martin Muwaga: that amount that that that

252
00:38:47.870 --&gt; 00:38:52.870
Martin Muwaga: let&#39;s chip in for now until that, because we are waiting for you.

sarahkayongo: Thank you so much. Thank you. So so I mean, guys, you don&#39;t know it. But but p. 2 is 75% haircut.

254
00:39:07.350 --&gt; 00:39:20.209
Patrick Muinda: Yes, I&#39;m going by that Scripture, the God that sees me and he&#39;s going to come through

255
00:39:20.290 --&gt; 00:39:26.130

258
00:39:34.110 --&gt; 00:39:38.470
Patrick Muinda: Of course, the my fish tank. But

259
00:39:38.580 --&gt; 00:39:40.260
it&#39;s the same thing. Yeah.

260
00:39:40.330 --&gt; 00:39:50.029
sarahkayongo: I put a link there so you can see the stuff. JJ, we didn&#39;t get stuff. Oh, yeah, I can share my screen so that you see

261
00:39:51.330 --&gt; 00:39:54.569
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you look in, the there&#39;s a link in the chat.

262
00:39:55.170 --&gt; 00:39:56.979
sarahkayongo: how

263
00:40:10.600 --&gt; 00:40:23.790
Abimereki Muzaale: cause you&#39;re driving from. So we didn&#39;t get so anyway. So there&#39;s a video I think the pass code. I didn&#39;t remember with the pass code. I look for it

264
00:40:23.980 --&gt; 00:40:28.219
Abimereki Muzaale: in case I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think you have time towards the video. But is it video

265
00:40:28.510 --&gt; 00:40:49.199
Abimereki Muzaale: if you want?

266
00:40:49.430 --&gt; 00:40:59.080
Abimereki Muzaale: But otherwise is my self reflection. After I reviewed the students.

267
00:40:59.180 --&gt; 00:41:14.300
sarahkayongo: comments over the last 2 years. Education theory

268
00:41:14.300 --&gt; 00:41:36.539
Abimereki Muzaale: never thought about ever before.

269
00:41:36.540 --&gt; 00:41:45.209
Abimereki Muzaale: but now my mind was so. I like I was not looking for this thing. I ran into them accidentally, this, this is not me. This is under my ideas, therefore psychology.

270
00:41:45.240 --&gt; 00:41:49.860
Abimereki Muzaale: And II ran into them, and I was like, Oh, my goodness, this is it.

271
00:41:50.320 --&gt; 00:41:58.939
Abimereki Muzaale: So? I am the one presenting challenge levels. The material presenting class and students have skill levels.

272
00:41:59.020 --&gt; 00:42:01.039
Abimereki Muzaale: So over time.

273
00:42:01.340 --&gt; 00:42:03.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Say, you&#39;ve said 8 week class.

274
00:42:04.030 --&gt; 00:42:08.060
Abimereki Muzaale: You can think of students coming 0 skills.

275
00:42:08.400 --&gt; 00:42:19.539
Abimereki Muzaale: And so the idea should meet me be that I present skills. Maybe at this level, they may be anxious a little, but II give them tools to allow them to move further down

276
00:42:19.740 --&gt; 00:42:31.090
Abimereki Muzaale: with time. Never thought about, but this is very well.

277
00:42:31.480 --&gt; 00:42:33.529
supported by research.

278
00:42:33.680 --&gt; 00:42:42.740
Abimereki Muzaale: And now, my conclusion actually, is to to have 3 separate classes for people at different levels, because coming at 0,

279
00:42:42.980 --&gt; 00:42:43.850
sarahkayongo: yeah.

280
00:42:44.350 --&gt; 00:42:46.360
Abimereki Muzaale: some people around here.

281
00:42:46.460 --&gt; 00:42:48.620
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you&#39;re giving material, yeah.

282
00:42:48.740 --&gt; 00:42:51.949
Abimereki Muzaale: they&#39;re going to. Actually, that appreciation is very important.

283
00:42:52.130 --&gt; 00:42:53.900
sarahkayongo: that that book.

284
00:42:54.100 --&gt; 00:42:58.309
sarahkayongo: It&#39;s very much what&#39;s

285
00:42:58.330 --&gt; 00:43:02.479
Patrick Muinda: so. So so now I&#39;m offering 3 different classes

286
00:43:02.680 --&gt; 00:43:06.800
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m going to offer 3 different classes. I don&#39;t know how. Get the time.

287
00:43:06.850 --&gt; 00:43:12.109
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, basic and intermediate advanced, so that

288
00:43:13.280 --&gt; 00:43:20.049
Abimereki Muzaale: no one is ever II don&#39;t have representing stuff at this level when someone&#39;s at the level 4, and they&#39;re bought.

289
00:43:20.220 --&gt; 00:43:21.100
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

290
00:43:41.760 --&gt; 00:43:46.030
Patrick Muinda: and then presents us with challenges. And then we all work together.

291
00:43:46.950 --&gt; 00:44:01.959
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s graduate level. But this is a graduate students. But that&#39;s students. And it&#39;s a very diverse group of people from all kinds of backgrounds.

292
00:44:02.010 --&gt; 00:44:20.290
Abimereki Muzaale: So it&#39;s like from the same departments. Some are medical students met that year out of the Phd students in their past year. Some of Mph. Students who Mp. Students almost do nothing because I know I know what Mph. Is. 9 months.

293
00:44:20.470 --&gt; 00:44:28.059
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;ve been exposed to everything in such a compact period. They have no skew, no advance knowledge of anything.

294
00:44:28.250 --&gt; 00:44:41.340
Abimereki Muzaale: So it&#39;s a mix of all kinds of people so it it for me as convinced. You know the deadline for so many new new courses and stuff was in September 30, and as able to do that.

295
00:44:41.690 --&gt; 00:44:51.119
Abimereki Muzaale: Say, that&#39;s what I&#39;m sharing. And I remember pee like this figure. And of course, if you want to copy and paste the code and edit if you can change content.

296
00:44:51.330 --&gt; 00:44:52.690
Abimereki Muzaale: So okay.

297
00:44:52.730 --&gt; 00:44:57.050
Abimereki Muzaale: But anyway, so the stuff is there. And so you said.

298
00:44:57.400 --&gt; 00:45:12.559
sarahkayongo: Still a can you go back to that top. I just want to see mine because the green zone

299
00:45:12.590 --&gt; 00:45:28.510
sarahkayongo: no, I mean I&#39;m still there. But I keep myself. Say, no, work doesn&#39;t stress me. I just as I say, they watch people, and then I know that you know it&#39;s temporary, and we&#39;ll get more work.

300
00:45:28.640 --&gt; 00:45:39.820
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, being in the green zone is a good thing at work. It enables you to do a lot of research.

301
00:45:39.840 --&gt; 00:45:42.290
Abimereki Muzaale: I agree. Yes, I agree. Yeah.

302
00:45:43.060 --&gt; 00:45:44.329
Martin: yeah. I mean.

303
00:45:44.350 --&gt; 00:45:48.950
Martin: I was looking at it mathematically if you just do a straight line, and

304
00:45:49.020 --&gt; 00:45:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: that comes with an angle of 45 degrees for a tangent of one which has

305
00:45:58.290 --&gt; 00:46:12.779
Martin: both both sides, both skill and challenge being at the same level. Anything on either side.

306
00:46:13.020 --&gt; 00:46:16.519
Abimereki Muzaale: People&#39;s one. Yeah.

307
00:46:17.110 --&gt; 00:46:20.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, American sports people call it being in the zone.

308
00:46:20.720 --&gt; 00:46:26.189
sarahkayongo: I heard that in finding Nemo

309
00:46:26.420 --&gt; 00:46:34.700
Patrick Muinda: Zone is where they call snapping.

310
00:46:35.780 --&gt; 00:46:39.839
sarahkayongo: you could stay there long enough.

311
00:46:39.990 --&gt; 00:46:43.859
sarahkayongo: You can snap stressful. This is very stressful place.

312
00:46:43.920 --&gt; 00:46:47.160
sarahkayongo: This is where my students majority of them are.

313
00:46:47.340 --&gt; 00:46:49.149
Martin: Well.

314
00:46:49.270 --&gt; 00:47:01.670
Martin: you should see the old guys in Usaid where we are walking in a Google document. And they create new Google documents and run over stuff. They download it into one.

315
00:47:01.790 --&gt; 00:47:04.309
Martin: What stuff they work offline!

316
00:47:04.370 --&gt; 00:47:08.789
Martin: Then they come back and throw stuff, you know.

317
00:47:08.940 --&gt; 00:47:19.349
Martin: mandatory training, mandatory training. Now, you&#39;re taking a Google documents. Me right now, anyone walking with me has to work with Github.

318
00:47:19.420 --&gt; 00:47:24.529
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s called the version control. So it&#39;s version, this with Silicon valley uses.

319
00:47:24.920 --&gt; 00:47:28.209
Abimereki Muzaale: so that

320
00:47:28.420 --&gt; 00:47:48.180
Abimereki Muzaale: the software takes care of versions because in Google, docs is very confusing. When you see everyone there updating stuff at the same time. But with this one, when you&#39;re doing update, then you write it what&#39;s called a commit message. Say, what changes have made. And that&#39;s the software is able to keep a history of that document over time and all the

321
00:47:48.340 --&gt; 00:47:53.030
Abimereki Muzaale: new additions by every individual over time.

322
00:47:53.190 --&gt; 00:47:55.750
Patrick Muinda: how is your picture now?

323
00:47:56.570 --&gt; 00:48:01.330
Actually, you know what I was about to tell you guys, I haven&#39;t gone to that, doctor.

324
00:48:01.670 --&gt; 00:48:06.580
sarahkayongo: but it&#39;s not painful at all and I can wear use.

325
00:48:06.900 --&gt; 00:48:10.400
Patrick Muinda: So we we went to the overall doctor.

326
00:48:10.440 --&gt; 00:48:16.929
sarahkayongo: Yeah, yeah, I think, you guys, yeah.

327
00:48:17.280 --&gt; 00:48:41.200
sarahkayongo: II did not go. She&#39;s doing well.

328
00:48:41.320 --&gt; 00:48:45.649
sarahkayongo: and then I got up for me a little bit. So

329
00:48:46.010 --&gt; 00:48:56.439
sarahkayongo: coming out of debt. Yeah, this is. This is intentional. So I&#39;m paying back every small and big

330
00:48:56.530 --&gt; 00:48:57.600
sarahkayongo: did.

331
00:48:57.790 --&gt; 00:49:05.420
sarahkayongo: which is my college dates, which is the biggest date I currently have.

332
00:49:05.440 --&gt; 00:49:23.410
sarahkayongo: The Biden administration really came out with all sorts of options for us. If you work for a nonprofit, you can actually have your date. Where? But I don&#39;t work for nonprofit right now.

333
00:49:23.540 --&gt; 00:49:37.309
sarahkayongo: Yeah. So I managed to talk to that loan. You know, you get a loan advisor. And she said, Well, I think you qualify for loan reducement.

334
00:49:37.460 --&gt; 00:49:42.989
sarahkayongo: And so I&#39;m gonna be paying $49 every month.

335
00:50:08.290 --&gt; 00:50:14.270
sarahkayongo: So I&#39;m very grateful for that. And actually, I did that during this

336
00:50:14.370 --&gt; 00:50:22.860
sarahkayongo: this past week, and I had a list of things to take care of, and that&#39;s one of the things

337
00:50:23.230 --&gt; 00:50:35.470
sarahkayongo: so breakthrough. And then I&#39;ve done some interviews. you know God is interesting. Because when I I&#39;m not looking for a job, jobs come to me

338
00:50:35.700 --&gt; 00:50:38.570
Martin: some interviews

339
00:50:38.630 --&gt; 00:50:48.860
sarahkayongo: and they are big jobs that I mean here in the U.S.A. Vp for business development for nonprofit and then but

340
00:50:48.930 --&gt; 00:50:55.560
sarahkayongo: I will leave God, who sees everything.

341
00:50:55.750 --&gt; 00:51:06.760
sarahkayongo: Yeah. And I need, I need, I continue to need a financial breakthrough. So I can complete all my projects, and, you know, prepare for retirement

342
00:51:07.110 --&gt; 00:51:13.430
sarahkayongo: and take care of the kids. So I know he would do something. I&#39;m no longer anxious.

343
00:51:13.550 --&gt; 00:51:16.240
sarahkayongo: So then the first part about

344
00:51:16.300 --&gt; 00:51:18.620
sarahkayongo: about my walk.

345
00:51:18.760 --&gt; 00:51:24.600
sarahkayongo: you know the Vp.

346
00:51:24.960 --&gt; 00:51:26.510
Martin: But talking

347
00:51:26.610 --&gt; 00:51:34.529
sarahkayongo: sees everything he would take care of. He would give me another job where I&#39;m challenged, and and I&#39;m not bored.

348
00:51:34.770 --&gt; 00:51:40.109
sarahkayongo: So I&#39;m grateful that I&#39;m actually where I have time to do other things.

349
00:51:40.200 --&gt; 00:51:43.679
sarahkayongo: Hmm! Which are personal

350
00:51:44.330 --&gt; 00:51:45.860
sarahkayongo: so, and young. Gish!

351
00:51:46.800 --&gt; 00:51:47.630
Hmm!

352
00:51:49.160 --&gt; 00:51:50.479
Martin: That is.

353
00:51:50.680 --&gt; 00:51:58.160
Patrick Muinda: we thank Good so much for what he has done in your life over this one month. Oh, is that it? Almost a month now?

354
00:51:58.240 --&gt; 00:52:01.070
sarahkayongo: God, yeah, God is everything. Yeah.

355
00:52:02.130 --&gt; 00:52:06.460
Patrick Muinda: Now for me. Number one. That motivation came.

356
00:52:06.600 --&gt; 00:52:07.820
I tell you.

357
00:52:08.400 --&gt; 00:52:11.910
Patrick Muinda: done so much work. Yes, it does, is my supervisor.

358
00:52:11.960 --&gt; 00:52:21.609
Patrick Muinda: So she&#39;s given me corrections that I need to implement. So I don&#39;t. II now have a clear direction, and I&#39;m very happy

359
00:52:22.470 --&gt; 00:52:24.520
Patrick Muinda: in the past. I was just

360
00:52:24.740 --&gt; 00:52:29.849
Patrick Muinda: not clear about what I was doing, and I was feeling really really terrible. But now it&#39;s cut out.

361
00:52:30.170 --&gt; 00:52:34.669
Patrick Muinda: scratch out, and I must emphasize this. This didn&#39;t come out strong enough

362
00:52:34.990 --&gt; 00:52:40.040
Patrick Muinda: here. I was ambiguous here. This is very good, so she gave me feedback.

363
00:52:40.640 --&gt; 00:52:52.249
Patrick Muinda: They have lunch today. That feedback is mostly negative. And if it&#39;s positive, then it is, it&#39;s only growing a constant.

364
00:52:52.890 --&gt; 00:52:54.440
Abimereki Muzaale: It is cancer.

365
00:52:54.650 --&gt; 00:52:56.260
Patrick Muinda: It is kazaa. Okay?

366
00:52:56.480 --&gt; 00:52:59.549
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So I think that&#39;s being home.

367
00:53:00.110 --&gt; 00:53:03.970
Patrick Muinda: Then, of course, I&#39;m very thankful to God for the conversation we had.

368
00:53:04.070 --&gt; 00:53:15.609
Patrick Muinda: You have said a lot of what I already knew. It&#39;s just that I did not think that you had gone through it as much as I thought you had, all of you. So for me, that has been such a reinforcement

369
00:53:16.080 --&gt; 00:53:18.250
Patrick Muinda: tonight. Continue towing. But

370
00:53:18.260 --&gt; 00:53:24.710
Patrick Muinda: it&#39;s not personal. Just just to add context to what Jujus said.

371
00:53:25.110 --&gt; 00:53:30.200
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;m not the only one who is having this type of thing with her. It&#39;s not just me.

372
00:53:30.450 --&gt; 00:53:42.490
Patrick Muinda: So yeah, it it is other people. So now I&#39;m tempted, II, to to join into conversations that I tell myself. No, this time I&#39;m not saying anything. I like my lessons from the format boss.

373
00:53:43.140 --&gt; 00:53:46.479
Patrick Muinda: When people come and cry about their frustration about him

374
00:53:46.560 --&gt; 00:53:47.849
I also share.

375
00:53:48.170 --&gt; 00:54:01.999
Martin: but before I know it he knows about it. Then I&#39;m in more trouble. Yes, they extract and burn, mess you up in 4 wheel drive. So in this one I don&#39;t.

376
00:54:02.270 --&gt; 00:54:07.440
sarahkayongo: Someone comes and cries their eyes out. Yeah, I just a month.

377
00:54:07.640 --&gt; 00:54:20.869
Patrick Muinda: I think. Let us trust God to see us through. Let let us let us keep on working hard, and, let&#39;s trust, go to give us victory as we do our work and do it excellently. That&#39;s what I tell them. I no longer say anything now.

378
00:54:21.100 --&gt; 00:54:22.940
sarahkayongo: and and by that has helped

379
00:54:22.970 --&gt; 00:54:28.089
Patrick Muinda: the turbulence in this regime is much less. It&#39;s terrible, but it&#39;s less than

380
00:54:39.770 --&gt; 00:54:43.689
Martin: you talk of those millennials. Drop Genesee

381
00:54:44.430 --&gt; 00:54:50.529
Martin: W. To me the biggest tragedy for them, I think. Well, I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a tragedy. But this

382
00:54:50.730 --&gt; 00:54:56.190
Martin: body of knowledge which is collectively put together, asking my daughters whether they ever read

383
00:54:56.260 --&gt; 00:54:59.480
Martin: textbook. Say, look at me. It&#39;s a textbook

384
00:54:59.780 --&gt; 00:55:25.679
Martin: like those text books that have been put together, which systematically explain the topic they&#39;re like. No, no, no, it is all these puzzles, as we said, of knowledge, Youtube, just quickly. There&#39;s like a same thing. They don&#39;t. They? Just Google, someone explain something. And it&#39;s really, really. And that&#39;s why I was curious when asking the about how many genesis are transitioning into doctor studies because there are no games.

385
00:55:25.810 --&gt; 00:55:35.990
Martin: There is a system

386
00:55:36.100 --&gt; 00:55:39.589
Martin: about to change for them.

387
00:55:39.720 --&gt; 00:55:44.010
Abimereki Muzaale: I can tell you that&#39;s the most brilliant person I might

388
00:55:44.420 --&gt; 00:55:45.140
Patrick Muinda: hmm!

389
00:55:45.530 --&gt; 00:55:51.830
Abimereki Muzaale: The most brilliant person I&#39;ve Metro, or is my master&#39;s in higher? It was my student is Gen. Z. Roughly.

390
00:55:52.010 --&gt; 00:56:17.900
Abimereki Muzaale: I should know. It&#39;s exactly

391
00:56:17.900 --&gt; 00:56:26.880
Patrick Muinda: number 3, number 3, that one God is going to do it, and I want to believe that the next time we meet telling you that the

392
00:56:27.050 --&gt; 00:56:39.009
Patrick Muinda: Public Service Commission has issued my minute, and that Hr. Has fixed the salary and want to believe that that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to be the next time we meet

393
00:56:53.650 --&gt; 00:56:56.000
sarahkayongo: setbacks. Yeah.

394
00:56:56.490 --&gt; 00:57:06.649
Patrick Muinda: then, then, then we also pray for Sarah, I mean for for Dorothy. She&#39;s going to do an American visa interview next week, or is it next week?

395
00:57:07.560 --&gt; 00:57:08.960
1, 20 fourth.

396
00:57:09.750 --&gt; 00:57:15.639
Patrick Muinda: So please remember, we don&#39;t want to lose that money, even if she&#39;s not travelling immediately with her mom.

397
00:57:16.160 --&gt; 00:57:23.309
sarahkayongo: Let her at least have it. If you have your 2 years, you can plan even next year, just get the visa.

398
00:57:23.740 --&gt; 00:57:27.720
Patrick Muinda: So so we are. Thank. We are thankful to hope that.

399
00:57:29.130 --&gt; 00:57:38.630
Martin: And I&#39;m going to. We are having a chat with Dodo. You know these? Us. Embassy interviews invariably take no more than 2 min.

400
00:57:38.950 --&gt; 00:57:53.440
Martin: This case with their determination. Right right away. It&#39;s not about land, titles and bank statements and all that. You look them in the eye. Just tell them, hey? I&#39;m here. Abcd.

401
00:57:53.780 --&gt; 00:57:55.749
Martin: and you out are all

402
00:57:57.580 --&gt; 00:57:58.320
yeah.

403
00:57:59.150 --&gt; 00:58:02.829
Martin: that is very true. Who go with Lantitos are kicked out, you know.

404
00:58:02.950 --&gt; 00:58:11.080
Patrick Muinda:  yeah. I once made a mistake, walked in and introduced myself as coming from Ministry of Education, said Minister of Education.

405
00:58:11.100 --&gt; 00:58:12.590
Patrick Muinda: Minister of Education.

406
00:58:12.600 --&gt; 00:58:21.079
Patrick Muinda: She gave me back my passport and said, We&#39;ll get back to you, said you. You don&#39;t need to. You don&#39;t need to to, to, to, to apply again.

407
00:58:22.180 --&gt; 00:58:32.139
Patrick Muinda: You, you! You! You Ja! Just wait! You&#39;ll hear from us. So my friends traveled. I stayed. I eventually got the visa, but after they were returning on when they&#39;re planning to return back from the Us.

408
00:58:32.250 --&gt; 00:58:36.169
Abimereki Muzaale: Why, why is that so, civil servant?

409
00:58:36.910 --&gt; 00:58:48.689
sarahkayongo: II think maybe I should have started that way, and once you come

410
00:58:48.700 --&gt; 00:58:50.810
Martin: for its own personal grounds.

411
00:58:50.950 --&gt; 00:58:56.979
Martin: And it&#39;s yes related like 12 national. Yeah, there should have been a diplomatic note attached.

412
00:58:57.310 --&gt; 00:59:01.919
Patrick Muinda: and yet as going on a private business. So I should not up fronted government.

413
00:59:01.950 --&gt; 00:59:07.590
Patrick Muinda: I learned that. Yeah, I shouldn&#39;t have. I should have just gone in my own right as me.

414
00:59:08.260 --&gt; 00:59:14.760
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So II have learned that. And to be assertive when you&#39;re talking to them, you don&#39;t sound apologetic.

415
00:59:15.040 --&gt; 00:59:21.289
Patrick Muinda: So their their number 5. Jay, thank you so much. Then number 6,

416
00:59:21.450 --&gt; 00:59:25.319
Patrick Muinda: we have gone through the weeks and wanted nothing. That&#39;s the same as today.

417
00:59:25.470 --&gt; 00:59:40.219
Patrick Muinda: The the the issue of number 7. God has done it. My leg continues to only get better. I&#39;m get. I&#39;m completely fine. I&#39;m not even going for physiotherapy anymore.

418
00:59:40.410 --&gt; 00:59:43.839
Patrick Muinda: I didn&#39;t even have to go for anything. I&#39;m just.

419
00:59:44.070 --&gt; 00:59:50.829
Patrick Muinda: The only thing I pray for is the post nozzle, drip thing that I&#39;m having. I&#39;m swallowing too much. So that once was a bit sold in here.

420
00:59:51.050 --&gt; 00:59:56.390
sarahkayongo: It&#39;s a bit irritating, so I might have to get some.

421
00:59:59.070 --&gt; 01:00:14.859
Abimereki Muzaale: II don&#39;t. I think it&#39;s analogic reaction or something where you feel you feel like there&#39;s a tap which is not well close, and you have a running nose. It can run backwards, down, down your throat.

422
01:00:14.950 --&gt; 01:00:17.400
Patrick Muinda: down the throat.

423
01:00:17.500 --&gt; 01:00:21.619
Abimereki Muzaale: I suppose, NASA driven so same conditions. Directions?

424
01:00:21.920 --&gt; 01:00:24.150
sarahkayongo: Yes.

425
01:00:24.390 --&gt; 01:00:38.490
Patrick Muinda: so so. So. I really pray against it. Cause now solving can become painful and UN inconveniencing cause. We are soling all the time the muscle that swallows you can almost feel the must cause I&#39;m solving literally all the time.

426
01:00:38.930 --&gt; 01:00:41.100
Patrick Muinda: So II really

427
01:00:41.160 --&gt; 01:00:46.320
Patrick Muinda: pray against that, and hope that this week I should have proper treatment. Get out of it

428
01:00:46.810 --&gt; 01:00:56.959
Patrick Muinda: then. We, we continue. We thank God for the school fees. Remember, we paid for fees. I tell you, all the fees were cleared. All we have no date.

429
01:00:57.040 --&gt; 01:01:01.850
Patrick Muinda: Wow! Absolutely.

430
01:01:02.620 --&gt; 01:01:10.059
Patrick Muinda: All the children are in school. It&#39;s just unbelievable over 8 million shillings, I&#39;m telling you

431
01:01:10.360 --&gt; 01:01:19.920
Patrick Muinda: so. I thank God so so so much! Nicole is going to school, but she has made it clear that she doesn&#39;t want to go that school anymore.

432
01:01:20.080 --&gt; 01:01:23.709
and she wants to go to another school where she can do things with her hands.

433
01:01:23.850 --&gt; 01:01:27.110
Patrick Muinda: So we&#39;re not good.

434
01:01:27.530 --&gt; 01:01:31.149
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday took her out. We had.

435
01:01:31.300 --&gt; 01:01:33.050
Patrick Muinda: We went out.

436
01:01:33.080 --&gt; 01:01:36.940
Martin: She dressed up well and went out on a date. It was very powerful.

437
01:01:36.950 --&gt; 01:01:38.950
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;ll send you the photos?

438
01:01:39.230 --&gt; 01:01:43.599
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So so we talked and she told me

439
01:01:43.930 --&gt; 01:01:50.919
Patrick Muinda: how she feels. Doesn&#39;t think being with those young babies in that class is really adding any value.

440
01:01:50.990 --&gt; 01:01:53.110
Patrick Muinda: She wants things now.

441
01:01:53.230 --&gt; 01:01:55.860
Patrick Muinda: yeah, very cool.

442
01:01:56.500 --&gt; 01:02:09.169
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So we pray she she gets engaged that that point that that we we get to know exactly what to do and where to go, and that God provides for us.

443
01:02:09.510 --&gt; 01:02:12.990
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. And that one is is

444
01:02:13.470 --&gt; 01:02:21.589
Patrick Muinda: I mean, the last one is more or less done. I pray that that Ph. D. Of will translate into something really really good.

445
01:02:21.650 --&gt; 01:02:24.340
and that finally, that that Ph. D.

446
01:02:24.730 --&gt; 01:02:25.890
Patrick Muinda: Will come.

447
01:02:26.000 --&gt; 01:02:36.940
Patrick Muinda: that I&#39;ll be able to complete it. I had a very great engagement with my supervisor. It was really, really I. She poured herself out from around 8 30 in the morning up to 2 PM.

448
01:02:36.980 --&gt; 01:02:41.629
Patrick Muinda: What she has just on me, no other student just me alone.

449
01:02:42.280 --&gt; 01:02:51.470
Patrick Muinda: So by the end of that I felt so, so, so, so so wonderful! I am so clear in my head about where to go. She gave so many examples

450
01:02:51.680 --&gt; 01:02:59.780
Patrick Muinda: about how other students made it. Those who failed, why they failed, how things should be presented, how things should be as simple as possible.

451
01:02:59.850 --&gt; 01:03:02.019
Lisa should be able to treat my thesis.

452
01:03:02.220 --&gt; 01:03:10.889
Patrick Muinda: and at least get some. Yes, yes, once things are not clear, then it causes my Max to be cut off during examination.

453
01:03:11.700 --&gt; 01:03:13.919
So that is the thing

454
01:03:14.070 --&gt; 01:03:23.990
Patrick Muinda: that is for me now. And of course my boss issues. I really pray that she gets out of my hair. But Scripture says we rest or not against flesh and blood

455
01:03:31.490 --&gt; 01:03:47.249
sarahkayongo: efficient. 10 to 18 every day put on the full arm of God, like, you know, the one for describes. He must have been looking at a Roman soldier. Because.

456
01:03:47.480 --&gt; 01:03:51.869
sarahkayongo: yeah.

457
01:03:52.360 --&gt; 01:04:10.770
Patrick Muinda: so you can see, the whole context is a context of war. It&#39;s a context of non stop warfare. And that&#39;s what we are in as Christians. It&#39;s warfare. Non stop every day.

458
01:04:11.140 --&gt; 01:04:16.079
sarahkayongo: By the way, yeah. So they tell us every day.

459
01:04:16.450 --&gt; 01:04:30.050
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So that is me. I just ask that we pray about that bus issue that God intervenes. It&#39;s a spiritual issue, however much I try to talk to my boss, it will not work, cause I&#39;ve tried. I even went to meet her on a Saturday.

460
01:04:30.190 --&gt; 01:04:35.990
Patrick Muinda: We sat together in a garden. Can you imagine in a garden, when I took her that letter from the first lady

461
01:04:36.190 --&gt; 01:04:39.380
we spoke. We talk. I thought she understood me.

462
01:04:39.890 --&gt; 01:04:43.089
Patrick Muinda: I got coming from Wau

463
01:04:43.120 --&gt; 01:04:48.609
Patrick Muinda: completely. Waste of time, waste of time, if anything, she&#39;s now using it against me.

464
01:04:48.640 --&gt; 01:05:00.990
Patrick Muinda: But you remember that letter you brought me? Well, now, that thing has turned out to be a problem. Now you&#39;re likely to be sucked into it. So get ready to answer, I said. Answer, what couriers don&#39;t answer.

465
01:05:01.270 --&gt; 01:05:05.780
Martin: You don&#39;t ask.

466
01:05:06.320 --&gt; 01:05:29.730
Martin: Well, I think what you what you need to to do it. So you you may need to come with an instrument to, to to sue her spirit. You know, David.

467
01:05:36.350 --&gt; 01:05:45.849
Patrick Muinda: no, just stay away. I don&#39;t report to her.

468
01:05:45.950 --&gt; 01:05:51.160
Patrick Muinda: I don&#39;t need that, so I report to my Under Secretary

469
01:05:51.170 --&gt; 01:05:56.449
Patrick Muinda: if I must respond to something to her through the Under Secretary, who forwards to her.

470
01:05:56.660 --&gt; 01:06:01.269
Patrick Muinda: Hmm, so I don&#39;t need her. I don&#39;t need to be with her

471
01:06:01.380 --&gt; 01:06:07.569
Patrick Muinda: at all. Yeah. So I&#39;m simply going to stay away from her. She&#39;s terrible every time I get close to her.

472
01:06:07.580 --&gt; 01:06:13.060
Patrick Muinda: It is criticism pointing out issues, reminding me of things of the past.

473
01:06:13.100 --&gt; 01:06:15.100
Patrick Muinda: And you you remember this.

474
01:06:15.620 --&gt; 01:06:20.850
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;ve never had that lady sit down with me, and we talk about anything constructive.

475
01:06:20.900 --&gt; 01:06:33.439
Patrick Muinda: how we are going to improve the education sector, how to strengthen. ICT nothing, nothing. It&#39;s criticism, fault finding politics, which is just very toxic

476
01:06:33.600 --&gt; 01:06:36.749
Abimereki Muzaale: it. ICT, really.

477
01:06:37.770 --&gt; 01:06:48.170
Patrick Muinda: yeah, yeah, yeah, there&#39;s so much to talk about. So I think my my strategy now is, stay away, stay in good. and let God do his thing. He knows what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s aware

478
01:06:48.390 --&gt; 01:06:51.979
Patrick Muinda: he knows me. God knows me. He&#39;s aware of what I&#39;m going through.

479
01:06:52.090 --&gt; 01:06:58.419
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;m not being disrespectful. I&#39;m not being abusive. I&#39;m doing my work. I report for duty and do it. Well.

480
01:06:58.550 --&gt; 01:07:04.010
Patrick Muinda: so I think what I&#39;ll do is simply do my work, trust God

481
01:07:04.170 --&gt; 01:07:07.220
and and and stay out of space.

482
01:07:07.650 --&gt; 01:07:12.360
Martin: Only be there. She needs me. but I&#39;ll be available.

483
01:07:12.620 --&gt; 01:07:14.400
Martin: Yeah, be available.

484
01:07:15.830 --&gt; 01:07:17.510
Martin: It will be wealthy.

485
01:07:18.050 --&gt; 01:07:21.620
sarahkayongo: Yeah, it will be. No, you&#39;ll be okay.

486
01:07:21.760 --&gt; 01:07:23.940
sarahkayongo: You&#39;ve been

487
01:07:24.070 --&gt; 01:07:25.670
sarahkayongo: by Jay.

488
01:07:25.930 --&gt; 01:07:26.720
Yes.

489
01:07:26.940 --&gt; 01:07:36.350
Martin: I did have. II didn&#39;t have anything to to share, as you record, but mine is really more of

490
01:07:37.250 --&gt; 01:07:42.959
Martin: Thanksgiving. In September Bria went back to

491
01:07:43.000 --&gt; 01:07:46.080
Martin: to school for her a levels. She&#39;s studying

492
01:07:46.260 --&gt; 01:07:49.370
Martin: mathematics, economics, and literature.

493
01:07:49.880 --&gt; 01:07:54.070
sarahkayongo:  Oh, and

494
01:07:54.710 --&gt; 01:08:06.539
Martin: we. She&#39;s really growing into this mature girl who really is is focused in what she what she does. Oh, and sociology for subjects.

495
01:08:06.780 --&gt; 01:08:10.529
Martin: you and let&#39;s pray for Gabby

496
01:08:10.880 --&gt; 01:08:12.090
Martin: Guppy.

497
01:08:12.200 --&gt; 01:08:19.539
Martin: Getty seems not to have you know she&#39;s gifted. But can you hear me, guys.

498
01:08:19.700 --&gt; 01:08:22.880
Martin: Yeah, gut, Guti doesn&#39;t seem to. I mean.

499
01:08:33.090 --&gt; 01:08:37.709
Martin: yeah, no. Just saying that. Let&#39;s just pray for Gapi to be.

500
01:08:37.750 --&gt; 01:08:48.880
Martin: you know, to to show more enthusiasm with work. Very gifted girl. But. you know, like bored with stuff, she drifts off in

501
01:08:49.189 --&gt; 01:09:06.810
sarahkayongo: in the in in in this stuff. And then she self diagnosed herself. She says she has Adhd.

502
01:09:06.899 --&gt; 01:09:15.720
Abimereki Muzaale: When does she come?

503
01:09:15.950 --&gt; 01:09:24.969
Martin: Patty pattishes she. Unfortunately she comes back earnest in December. But we that&#39;s not a problem. We can set up a call.

504
01:09:25.620 --&gt; 01:09:26.720
Patrick Muinda: Okay.

505
01:09:27.450 --&gt; 01:09:31.090
Martin: I can set up that call for you, too. She&#39;s she&#39;s going to be

506
01:09:31.200 --&gt; 01:09:35.700
Martin: joining home mom next week in

507
01:09:35.960 --&gt; 01:09:39.130
in Cyril Leon. So she is not coming for half time here.

508
01:09:39.270 --&gt; 01:09:40.740
Abimereki Muzaale: She&#39;s going online. Okay?

509
01:09:45.380 --&gt; 01:09:51.780
Martin: No, no, no, with bread. I will join them later.  so

510
01:09:51.890 --&gt; 01:09:56.699
Martin: So apart from that one, let&#39;s pray for for hand, I&#39;ll Gabili.

511
01:10:00.930 --&gt; 01:10:10.000
Martin: I think. Also that group masculine blah blah blah just to to it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a generational thing. But for her to

512
01:10:10.690 --&gt; 01:10:12.050
Martin: to, you know.

513
01:10:12.140 --&gt; 01:10:19.019
Martin: return to her roots, and at least appreciate what is truly authentic and not just.

514
01:10:19.350 --&gt; 01:10:24.819
Martin: Yeah, she should have some kind of filters through which she sees all this feedback she gets from

515
01:10:25.270 --&gt; 01:10:29.930
Martin: from from friends and all that. Let&#39;s just commit. That is very true.

516
01:10:30.160 --&gt; 01:10:42.760
Martin: Yeah, going on really? Well, one of the things that I would like you to

517
01:10:43.070 --&gt; 01:10:44.480
Martin: pray for me.

518
01:10:44.850 --&gt; 01:10:52.920
Martin: There is thorough knows the category of stuff. I belong to its. They are called foreign service Nationals.

519
01:10:53.600 --&gt; 01:10:56.130
Martin: and some of the power

520
01:10:56.420 --&gt; 01:11:05.139
Martin: Samantha Power has recently put in place some new agency initiatives,

521
01:11:05.190 --&gt; 01:11:10.440
Martin: which focus on empowerment of foreign service, national. And so now

522
01:11:10.670 --&gt; 01:11:13.230
Martin: a their husband

523
01:11:13.710 --&gt; 01:11:20.320
Martin: for each of the major departments and bureaus. One of the deputy directors has to be

524
01:11:20.910 --&gt; 01:11:25.969
Martin: a Ugandan. OAOA national, a foreign service national of the country!

525
01:11:26.350 --&gt; 01:11:36.619
Martin: So there! There are some positions that are going to be coming up. And one of them, which I&#39;m looking at, his position of deputy program&#39;s director.

526
01:11:36.880 --&gt; 01:11:46.370
Martin: So they&#39;d be a Deputy health Director health Office director, Deputy Economic Growth Director, but the one end of which I am

527
01:11:46.960 --&gt; 01:11:54.910
Martin: there was a lot of pushback, naturally, from Americans who found it outrageous that you can.

528
01:11:55.260 --&gt; 01:12:05.980
sarahkayongo: foreign service nationals who in Nairobi, literally the offices, 90% Kenyans?

529
01:12:06.070 --&gt; 01:12:13.170
Martin: No, but Kenyans at different level. Those ones are so highly skilled. They run the show. They take no nonsense from the zoom.

530
01:12:13.240 --&gt; 01:12:19.850
sarahkayongo: Their country demands that they should have those top positions.

531
01:12:20.070 --&gt; 01:12:34.160
Martin: and and and my friend told me when you&#39;re going like an American being reassigned to to to Kenya. They they just tell them that. Just stay in your lane. These guys know what they are doing. Your job is not to

532
01:12:34.300 --&gt; 01:12:47.340
sarahkayongo: what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s just, you know, some missions, Kenya. I went to the mission, though. Would you move? Do you merely literally Kenyan.

533
01:12:47.870 --&gt; 01:12:49.579
sarahkayongo: I was so impressed.

534
01:12:49.650 --&gt; 01:12:59.289
Martin: People people know what they&#39;re doing. So let&#39;s pray for that. Breakthrough for the position of deputy programs, director as and when it becomes available.

535
01:12:59.400 --&gt; 01:13:05.259
Martin: This is not really about me per se. But one thing that really

536
01:13:05.280 --&gt; 01:13:12.530
Martin: I keep committing to prayer is my Dad, really, truly, truly, truly, Daddy.

537
01:13:12.850 --&gt; 01:13:18.289
Martin: finding peace, you know. Sometimes we have these conversations like Kadi Gay.

538
01:13:21.360 --&gt; 01:13:26.470
Abimereki Muzaale: II didn&#39;t tell you how that conversation about the

539
01:13:26.790 --&gt; 01:13:27.510
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

540
01:13:29.910 --&gt; 01:13:31.950
Martin: Say that that.

541
01:13:32.470 --&gt; 01:13:41.980
Martin: Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I was like that. You are truly, truly, truly blessed. I&#39;m about to turn 50, and I realize

542
01:13:42.370 --&gt; 01:13:43.810
Martin: you have. You have.

543
01:13:46.820 --&gt; 01:13:50.220
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, your phone is on and off. You don&#39;t know

544
01:13:51.630 --&gt; 01:13:55.650
sarahkayongo: you&#39;re breaking off.

545
01:13:56.020 --&gt; 01:14:01.890
Martin: Yeah, II do not know what&#39;s happening. II think it has something to do with my network, can you?

546
01:14:03.210 --&gt; 01:14:05.760
sarahkayongo: Can you still hear me?

547
01:14:06.530 --&gt; 01:14:09.519
Patrick Muinda: You said he was 45 when he did what?

548
01:14:09.750 --&gt; 01:14:15.059
Martin: No, he was 58 when he became chair apostle PSC.

549
01:14:15.570 --&gt; 01:14:27.570
Martin:  58. Us. And that&#39;s like you have been so blessed, and you held that position. I&#39;ve been told him how we&#39;re waiting, having lunch with

550
01:14:27.820 --&gt; 01:14:33.310
Martin: my father-in-law, Ki Kishuka, and the the Kamundos and the Rakasis, and they were like what

551
01:14:33.430 --&gt; 01:14:39.080
Martin: this guy was chairperson for 16 years. They even shifted to Ro Nakura and said, What did this guy do?

552
01:14:39.580 --&gt; 01:14:49.870
Martin: Who, you know? He&#39;s not part of the guys who made the sacrifices. He had been there for a long time for 10 years, because he had broken the U Cb. Bank for

553
01:14:50.120 --&gt; 01:14:51.220
Martin: the rib boots.

554
01:14:51.520 --&gt; 01:14:58.669
Martin: you know. Sounds like that. You&#39;ve been blessed like this, but has like that changing of the mind. I some. I sometimes find it

555
01:14:58.870 --&gt; 01:15:01.650
Martin: upsetting. Khadi says that I indulge him.

556
01:15:01.880 --&gt; 01:15:16.650
Martin: but you started off by saying he needs peace, so he&#39;s not peaceful about that, or he&#39;s not appreciative. Or let me. You guys know what I&#39;m talking about that the post

557
01:15:17.710 --&gt; 01:15:19.460
sarahkayongo: are complaining.

558
01:15:21.940 --&gt; 01:15:24.949
Martin: No, not really forget.

559
01:15:26.830 --&gt; 01:15:30.910
Martin: But party is gratitude an issue of memory, or is it a mindset?

560
01:15:32.170 --&gt; 01:15:32.870
Martin: Hmm!

561
01:15:33.320 --&gt; 01:15:37.799
sarahkayongo: We need to be reminded sometimes, and I&#39;m reminded of what it has done for me.

562
01:15:37.850 --&gt; 01:15:40.510
Patrick Muinda: It it puts me back on track.

563
01:15:40.990 --&gt; 01:15:50.080
Patrick Muinda: In fact, I become humble and even repent and say, God forgive me for what I&#39;ve been thinking and say, sometimes you just need to be reminded.

564
01:15:51.410 --&gt; 01:15:58.390
sarahkayongo: oh, yeah, that&#39;s so good, that is so good. But anyway, ask why?

565
01:15:58.940 --&gt; 01:16:01.760
Martin: You may ask where I brought this up, but

566
01:16:01.850 --&gt; 01:16:03.820
Martin: but it&#39;s upsetting. Yeah.

567
01:16:04.180 --&gt; 01:16:11.950
Martin: I brought it up because it&#39;s upsetting it. It sometimes gets, and we are always going round and round and round and round.

568
01:16:12.190 --&gt; 01:16:14.230
Martin: Yes.

569
01:16:14.420 --&gt; 01:16:25.640
Martin: IIII told Kadi that when the dead is went to the village for some time. It was like I got a bit of a breath as like, Oh, you know it can&#39;t drain you. You get to have your 4, 5 days.

570
01:16:36.310 --&gt; 01:16:48.010
sarahkayongo: because I would sit there and moan about this and complain.

571
01:16:48.100 --&gt; 01:16:58.220
sarahkayongo: Yeah, III see that unfortunately, I see where this is coming from. I told you months ago.

572
01:16:58.650 --&gt; 01:16:59.490
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh.

573
01:17:00.570 --&gt; 01:17:07.440
Martin: yeah, so that is not mine peculiar to me. It affects me quite a bit, but I think it&#39;s a prayer for all of us.

574
01:17:07.620 --&gt; 01:17:10.610
Patrick Muinda: Just leave it under you. Yeah.

575
01:17:10.820 --&gt; 01:17:17.590
Martin: Yeah. And finally, Brenda, let&#39;s keep praying for Brenda. You know she&#39;s so far away.

576
01:17:18.150 --&gt; 01:17:26.260
Martin: But at first, the first time I arrived in Sierra Leone. Just the sheer trouble that it&#39;s like a whole day&#39;s

577
01:17:26.370 --&gt; 01:17:39.630
Martin: trouble is like, really. What what the hell are you doing? Is this really what life is about that someone goes halfway across the world. But Brenda is enjoying her work. She&#39;s coming into her own.

578
01:17:39.950 --&gt; 01:17:46.569
Martin: This is a much more senior position. She&#39;s the chief of nutrition. There

579
01:17:46.590 --&gt; 01:17:50.219
Martin: we are. We are praying for a breakthrough for how to get.

580
01:17:50.890 --&gt; 01:17:56.830
Martin: You know Cyril Leone is an unfamiliar duty station, so she can start applying after a Yah!

581
01:17:57.160 --&gt; 01:17:58.610
Martin: We&#39;re not the

582
01:17:58.800 --&gt; 01:18:05.060
Martin: for another posting. So we are. We will be coming to a yeah in July next year.

583
01:18:05.570 --&gt; 01:18:15.600
Martin: So from then she can start applying. So let&#39;s just keep that at the back of our mind. She really really has a prayer to

584
01:18:15.830 --&gt; 01:18:18.689
Martin: be able to move to to Nairobi.

585
01:18:19.240 --&gt; 01:18:25.519
Martin: where she she she really feels she&#39;s not been able, and I agree with her being able to be there with the girls

586
01:18:25.760 --&gt; 01:18:31.469
Martin: as much unengaged, mother. So let&#39;s put that request for

587
01:18:32.040 --&gt; 01:18:41.610
Martin: being closer for me. and when you&#39;re in Nairobi. You&#39;re in Kampala for all intents and purposes you&#39;re 45 min away. Yeah.

588
01:18:43.540 --&gt; 01:18:46.440
Martin: Kali, that&#39;s it from me.

589
01:18:46.600 --&gt; 01:18:48.570
Patrick Muinda: The hmm.

590
01:18:48.620 --&gt; 01:18:52.210
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. A a few us here last time. Yeah. So

591
01:18:53.570 --&gt; 01:19:05.510
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, as giving thanks for my summer. There&#39;s a very summer, the the last 2 months, 2 and a half months or so where II literally did nothing else.

592
01:19:05.780 --&gt; 01:19:11.420
Abimereki Muzaale: But it must myself in a while, which is 100% new to me using AI

593
01:19:12.090 --&gt; 01:19:19.529
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, so that that that is very exciting new tools. And

594
01:19:19.870 --&gt; 01:19:25.599
Abimereki Muzaale: I want to, I&#39;m I&#39;m going to be using them. I&#39;ve created a platform that allows me to collaborate

595
01:19:25.830 --&gt; 01:19:30.059
Abimereki Muzaale: more smoothly with students, colleagues.

596
01:19:30.260 --&gt; 01:19:31.450
Abimereki Muzaale: peers

597
01:19:31.720 --&gt; 01:19:36.790
Abimereki Muzaale: and you know, a anyone interacting with me in any capacity

598
01:19:36.870 --&gt; 01:19:39.090
Abimereki Muzaale: now goes through a system

599
01:19:39.840 --&gt; 01:19:46.789
Abimereki Muzaale: platform that it created. Yeah. So very excited about that, because it allows me to

600
01:19:46.980 --&gt; 01:19:49.220
Abimereki Muzaale: to to do much more

601
01:19:49.380 --&gt; 01:19:51.459
Abimereki Muzaale: than I would do as an individual

602
01:19:51.960 --&gt; 01:19:54.529
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;ll be able to do as an individual. So I&#39;m grateful.

603
01:19:55.570 --&gt; 01:19:59.710
Abimereki Muzaale: And you know, although they detain things as always.

604
01:19:59.870 --&gt; 01:20:04.490
Abimereki Muzaale: I I recently ordered new shoes.

605
01:20:04.590 --&gt; 01:20:13.340
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m an exercise, but at least I mean the process.

606
01:20:13.420 --&gt; 01:20:25.789
Martin: Oh, fixing this had you have these guys see those shoes? Sort of you see the shoes.

607
01:20:25.900 --&gt; 01:20:31.670
Martin: But but we need to mobilize money and and all the shoes.

608
01:20:31.710 --&gt; 01:20:39.050
Martin: Bokadiep, bring them! Trust me, you wear these trainers. Your knees will never feel a thing you just bounce on air.

609
01:20:39.060 --&gt; 01:20:45.070
sarahkayongo: Oh, you mean the

610
01:20:45.070 --&gt; 01:21:09.969
Abimereki Muzaale: the prices are down that come down the 300 in 2021 this time, which is 1 50. So that&#39;s a huge difference. Yeah, I&#39;m going to place an order the moment I can. And you please come with them. Oh, yeah, you just need to clarify, you know the virtual last time. I don&#39;t remember if the size was fine, I think the 11 and a half is all

611
01:21:09.970 --&gt; 01:21:10.530
okay.

612
01:21:10.720 --&gt; 01:21:12.550
Abimereki Muzaale: Can you confirm and say his advice.

613
01:21:12.900 --&gt; 01:21:20.550
Martin: But it was 11, and I think for me, I am 12. I just

614
01:21:20.650 --&gt; 01:21:22.569
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. 12 is safe for running

615
01:21:22.820 --&gt; 01:21:43.989
Abimereki Muzaale: women shoes.

616
01:21:55.670 --&gt; 01:22:02.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Uk.

617
01:22:03.170 --&gt; 01:22:11.400
sarahkayongo: are you guys different? What you mentioned sounds like mommy size, that kind of size.

618
01:22:11.920 --&gt; 01:22:33.200
Abimereki Muzaale: I know me. I think even Brenda will need.

619
01:22:33.220 --&gt; 01:23:03.179
Abimereki Muzaale: Yep. So you. You may not just come in with your rocks.

620
01:23:03.180 --&gt; 01:23:11.029
Abimereki Muzaale: So yeah. So I began hopefully, my final year, the Phd fourth year

621
01:23:11.280 --&gt; 01:23:18.000
Abimereki Muzaale: I only Phd. Requirements is the only thing sorry, not Phd requirements, only thesis

622
01:23:18.090 --&gt; 01:23:21.779
sarahkayongo: is what I&#39;m supposed to be focused on. DC.

623
01:23:22.260 --&gt; 01:23:51.389
Abimereki Muzaale:  I haven&#39;t done anything yet.

624
01:23:51.470 --&gt; 01:23:58.500
sarahkayongo: So it should be easy. But you know,

625
01:23:58.890 --&gt; 01:24:02.950
Abimereki Muzaale: I do not have all the data with me paid

626
01:24:03.040 --&gt; 01:24:18.849
Abimereki Muzaale: surface some data, and I just need to schedule time to access those data and all that stuff. But the main thing I&#39;ve been doing is my latest hire is laying down some automating set of processes for me that will make this a breeze

627
01:24:19.070 --&gt; 01:24:27.519
Abimereki Muzaale: laid down. I should move at very high speed. So let&#39;s pray that that happens sooner.

628
01:24:27.550 --&gt; 01:24:30.940
Abimereki Muzaale: and data, and then in the process of

629
01:24:31.600 --&gt; 01:24:39.379
Abimereki Muzaale: Pi think, prayed about it, but I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t write it down, but he prayed about it. My grants. Yeah.

630
01:24:39.400 --&gt; 01:24:43.199
Abimereki Muzaale: I need. I did. I need. I need grants. The more grants I have.

631
01:24:43.210 --&gt; 01:25:10.239
Abimereki Muzaale: The more jay I took about that percent. Yes, that applies everywhere, so I should call it protected time protected from seeing patients so protected from academic. The more money you have, the the more free. I do. Whatever is your beating

632
01:25:10.270 --&gt; 01:25:12.899
Abimereki Muzaale: so so grunt.

633
01:25:13.110 --&gt; 01:25:22.940
sarahkayongo: I wanted to submit October, but I&#39;ve not been able to. So next cycle is February.

634
01:25:22.970 --&gt; 01:25:27.029
Abimereki Muzaale: and so I pray that putting this together, that&#39;s a lot of work.

635
01:25:27.380 --&gt; 01:25:44.490
Martin: And and I just, I need to. I need to select collaborators and investigators. But, Kadi Khadi, you have because that means you have essentially October, November, and

636
01:25:44.710 --&gt; 01:25:55.349
Martin: that&#39;s pretty much it

637
01:25:55.640 --&gt; 01:26:06.500
Abimereki Muzaale: so II don&#39;t feel anything in my hip since the last.

638
01:26:06.550 --&gt; 01:26:20.520
Abimereki Muzaale: yes, symptom

639
01:26:21.730 --&gt; 01:26:29.660
Abimereki Muzaale: clearing my sinuses but II will consider seeing an ent session

640
01:26:30.530 --&gt; 01:26:34.000
Abimereki Muzaale: in the next month, or based on

641
01:26:34.200 --&gt; 01:26:41.730
Abimereki Muzaale: how I I&#39;ll be doing by then, but I feel much better. I can smell. I couldn&#39;t smell. I couldn&#39;t smell food.

642
01:26:41.920 --&gt; 01:26:43.820
Martin: I can see. Well.

643
01:26:43.880 --&gt; 01:26:46.329
Abimereki Muzaale: but now I can smell. I can smell the air

644
01:26:46.450 --&gt; 01:26:48.890
Abimereki Muzaale: and breathe better. So.

645
01:26:49.230 --&gt; 01:26:58.830
Abimereki Muzaale: This is the platform that is describing. So this this growth hasn&#39;t yet started because I haven&#39;t did expose people to it. I&#39;ve just been building it.

646
01:26:59.380 --&gt; 01:27:03.130
Abimereki Muzaale: But it&#39;s a platform through which people will be interacting with me.

647
01:27:03.470 --&gt; 01:27:08.350
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So so, yeah, so, so this is my press. So just give me one

648
01:27:08.420 --&gt; 01:27:11.020
Abimereki Muzaale: minute to

649
01:27:12.190 --&gt; 01:27:12.890
Abimereki Muzaale: oh.

650
01:27:13.090 --&gt; 01:27:16.520
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, I mean it just to

651
01:27:17.370 --&gt; 01:27:22.989
Abimereki Muzaale: transfer this cause. There&#39;s no freighting to transfer this year. I can copy and paste

652
01:27:24.020 --&gt; 01:27:25.700
Abimereki Muzaale: a few things here.

653
01:27:28.170 --&gt; 01:27:40.140
Martin: The Ministry of Education of Australia has formally introduced AI as a core tool that has to be used right from the get-go

654
01:27:40.220 --&gt; 01:27:43.669
Martin: in instruction. There was a lot of pushback from

655
01:27:43.820 --&gt; 01:27:56.900
Martin: parents and all that, but II just had the the, the press Conference of the Minister for Education, saying, no. You remember how we were against the calculator being handed to kids.

656
01:27:57.600 --&gt; 01:28:03.250
sarahkayongo: That&#39;s practical. Yes.

657
01:28:03.300 --&gt; 01:28:14.710
Abimereki Muzaale: most natural reaction across the world. AI has been in education wilders to to, to to ban it by gradually. Yeah.

658
01:28:14.840 --&gt; 01:28:28.999
Abimereki Muzaale: Evolving moving away from that. And for me. My, I got exposed to AI through a data science class. So II don&#39;t understand when people are regulations and risks cause for me. I&#39;ve been using it to develop apps.

659
01:28:29.150 --&gt; 01:28:41.880
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m like, what? So so when you&#39;re using Sunday for engineering, you roll your eyes at other people&#39;s consignments.

660
01:28:42.350 --&gt; 01:28:43.400
Abimereki Muzaale: A

661
01:28:43.820 --&gt; 01:28:45.090
actually

662
01:28:45.660 --&gt; 01:28:48.009
Martin: that thing data sciences.

663
01:28:48.330 --&gt; 01:28:58.890
Patrick Muinda: I know. Patty got Chat Gbt. To write Martin a letter convincing him to pursue a career in data science brilliant.

664
01:28:59.650 --&gt; 01:29:07.329
Martin: He just spoke audio audio. To the mic is delivered that audio very

665
01:29:07.370 --&gt; 01:29:16.569
Martin: converted, but it was a brilliant, brilliant analysis, and us like, now look at this. This is not even funny.

666
01:29:16.900 --&gt; 01:29:31.429
sarahkayongo: No, I don&#39;t.

667
01:29:31.670 --&gt; 01:29:34.619
Martin: I do for a while. My post, yeah.

668
01:29:35.380 --&gt; 01:29:42.609
sarahkayongo: And then when she saw it, she&#39;s like fantastic. This is good. In fact, your let&#39;s put you on the Ukraine.

669
01:29:42.840 --&gt; 01:29:45.139
sarahkayongo: Well, the Ukraine project.

670
01:29:45.930 --&gt; 01:29:55.980
sarahkayongo: It was more of a speculation.

671
01:29:56.330 --&gt; 01:30:00.119
Patrick Muinda: One thing I see

672
01:30:00.520 --&gt; 01:30:03.640
Patrick Muinda: is that you need to know how to ask the right question.

673
01:30:03.690 --&gt; 01:30:07.180
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Oh, the media to ask the right question. Detail.

674
01:30:07.350 --&gt; 01:30:09.590
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yes. Yes.

675
01:30:09.860 --&gt; 01:30:17.520
Patrick Muinda: Well, once once you&#39;re able to ask the right thing in the right intensity and detail. I tell you it will work for you.

676
01:30:17.590 --&gt; 01:30:21.780
Patrick Muinda: but someone who doesn&#39;t know how to do that will find it a very boring tool.

677
01:30:22.320 --&gt; 01:30:32.540
sarahkayongo: Now, in in research, even, you&#39;re talking now like a research at the right research question. Everything.

678
01:30:33.250 --&gt; 01:30:34.160
sarahkayongo: Yeah.

679
01:30:34.270 --&gt; 01:30:35.720
Martin: very, very true.

680
01:30:35.750 --&gt; 01:30:37.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Alright. So

681
01:30:37.650 --&gt; 01:30:42.590
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I&#39;ve finished posting here. It&#39;s it&#39;s going to take about 30 s to load.

682
01:30:42.840 --&gt; 01:30:47.470
Patrick Muinda: I wanted to understand from you

683
01:30:47.650 --&gt; 01:31:01.139
Patrick Muinda: why is ending the Phd. Tougher than starting it, cause II want to finish. But everything seems to be there. There&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t have.

684
01:31:01.300 --&gt; 01:31:09.680
Martin: I&#39;m trying to finish, and since slowing down like landing on aircraft is just. Yeah. Landing is harder than take off.

685
01:31:10.250 --&gt; 01:31:18.730
sarahkayongo: anyway. Now you have to assemble all these things, and you you&#39;ll even have to forget where you started.

686
01:31:18.740 --&gt; 01:31:28.460
sarahkayongo: We? Okay? Oh, yeah, that has changed a lot has changed exactly. It seems like you did it long time ago.

687
01:31:28.760 --&gt; 01:31:36.729
sarahkayongo: And then here volume of data you have to go through to now. Begin writing.

688
01:31:38.150 --&gt; 01:31:44.910
sarahkayongo: III don&#39;t remember. Sorry you know what I&#39;ve completed writing.

689
01:31:45.060 --&gt; 01:31:49.549
Patrick Muinda: I&#39;ve finished writing. But now putting it all together.

690
01:31:49.570 --&gt; 01:31:56.460
sarahkayongo: No, no, putting it together in the form that is a real, that is a synthesis. Now

691
01:31:56.720 --&gt; 01:32:02.059
Martin: you have data points, information of the writing which sections

692
01:32:03.070 --&gt; 01:32:14.200
Patrick Muinda: I have finished my my chapter. One introduction through Literature Review. I&#39;ve done methodology. I&#39;ve written my findings. I&#39;m now in discussion of findings.

693
01:32:15.680 --&gt; 01:32:19.179
sarahkayongo: You. Okay, yeah, wait. Wait.

694
01:32:19.600 --&gt; 01:32:30.200
Martin: You did your data analysis already. Yes, I&#39;m done. And the results are so exciting. I&#39;m going to share with you.

695
01:32:43.420 --&gt; 01:32:47.109
sarahkayongo: I&#39;m through like a a

696
01:32:47.930 --&gt; 01:32:50.070
Patrick Muinda: Hi, I&#39;m good enough.

697
01:32:50.630 --&gt; 01:33:17.409
sarahkayongo: I&#39;m I&#39;m through the data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, using thematic analysis for the qualitative. I use the structure equation.

698
01:33:18.400 --&gt; 01:33:21.039
sarahkayongo: III don&#39;t even.
